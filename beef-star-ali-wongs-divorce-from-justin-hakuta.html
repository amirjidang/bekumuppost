When we said that we were lovingly co-parenting and focusing on the kids, we really meant it. That wasn’t just a statement. To me, that’s kind of boring. And in terms of my act, and what I choose to talk about, how I decide for myself is all instinct. I can always feel if it’s too much."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Christine Baumgartner Really Believe She Would Keep Living In Kevin Costner's $145 Million Santa Barbara House After Filing For Divorce?</a></span></p><p>She also said, "Up until recently, my personal life was actually quite boring" and mentioned that having paparazzi snap pictures has been "strange."</p><p>In her interview with The Cut, Wong also said that she makes sure to keep many parts of her personal life out of her comedy act.
