Let's dive in!</p><h2 id=a-timeline-of-jennifer-aniston-39-s-dating-history>A Timeline Of Jennifer Aniston's Dating History</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer Aniston has lived quite a public life when it comes to her romances. The star's first major relationship came about in 1998 when she and Brad Pitt began dating. The duo was all anyone could talk about and considering their status in Hollywood and dashing looks, it's no surprise they were such a hot topic. Well, despite tying the knot in 2000, Brad and Jen called it quits in 2005 when rumors began swirling of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad cheating on Aniston</a> with fellow actress, Angelina Jolie.</p><p>Jennifer quickly moved on with co-star Vince Vaughn the same year her divorce was finalized, however, Aniston and Vaugh ended things a year later. Although the Friends actress stayed single for a while, she was rumored to be dating singer, John Mayer. Well, turns out the rumors were true, however, much like her past romances, theirs also came to an end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2011, Jennifer Aniston began dating Justin Theroux, and fans had a good feeling about these two. In 2015, the duo officially tied the knot and were said to be the perfect match, however, that too was debunked following <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their split in 2017.</a> Luckily, Jen and Justin have remained close friends, despite their split, making it clear that they may have been better off as friends, to begin with.</p><p>Now, Jennifer is revealing whether or not she's ready to start dating again, and who exactly she would go for. Although she's been there and done that when it comes to dating other celebs, perhaps it's time she goes for someone who isn't famous.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Friends': Joey And Rachel's Romance Was Almost Cut Out Of The Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=could-she-date-a-man-who-isn-39-t-famous>Could She Date A Man Who Isn't Famous?</h2><p>Well, turns out that Jennifer Aniston is not only ready to get back out there, but she's definitely up to the idea of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dating someone who is not a public figure</a>. During an interview with People, Aniston was asked if she'd ever go for someone unknown. "Of course!" she said. "Absolutely. I mean, it's happened. That's what I'm sort of hoping for is not necessarily somebody in the industry itself."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer went on to reveal that dating someone who isn't famous would be "nice." The actress was also asked about the ongoing rumors regarding her relationship with David Schwimmer, however, those ended up being just rumors. "I could not believe that, actually. Like, really? That's my brother!" she responded. So, while she isn't dating David, it seems as if she might be setting her sights on someone none of us know.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: T<a href=#>he Real Reason Fans Are Obsessed With Who Jennifer Aniston Is Dating</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaqK2cmXqrsc2noJ%2BdomKur7XSraanZZWrsrN5w5qrnmWjpLqmu82eZLCgn2K2tLrTZp2apZ%2BqwHA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./is-marcus-ericsson-married-wife-to-be-iris-tritsaris-jondahl-here-is-what-we-know-about-the-indycar-driver-310729-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is Marcus Ericsson Married?
