deciding on an equal pay between the main six. That was significant, even though David and <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a></strong> could've made the most among the entire cast.</p><p>It proved to be the correct decision and years later, the cast continues to make millions per year, while the supporting players, aren't doing too shabby either, making thousands per year since the show came to an end.</p><p>In the following, we're going to take a look at just how much money Friends makes per year. A certain guest star on Friends was shocked by his residual pay, despite the fact that he only appeared twice early on. We'll reveal what he had to say, and what his experience was like on the show.</p><p>Let's take a closer look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/00.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston And Courteney Cox Enjoyed More Success Than Lisa Kudrow Outside Of Friends, And I Figured Out Why</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Lisa Kudrow's fame from Friends was different compared to Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox.</span><h2 id=vincent-ventresca-got-residuals-of-2k-despite-only-appearing-in-two-episodes-of-friends>Vincent Ventresca Got Residuals Of $2K Despite Only Appearing In Two Episodes Of Friends</h2><p>It is well-known by now, the cast of Friends continues to make a fortune thanks to their success. It is said that Warner Bros. makes $1 billion per year from the show, which results in $20 million each for the main cast.</p><p>The supporting players aren't making that type of money, but they're still getting something which is very significant considering residuals are shrinking due to streaming platforms like <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong>. Take Elliot Gould and Christina Pickles. Both are rumored to be making an extra $20K from the show despite their limited appearances. The same holds true for Maggie Wheeler, rumored to be making $19K per year.</p><p>Perhaps the most bizarre of all the residuals goes to Vincent Ventresca. He played the memorable role of Fun Bobby for two episodes. Despite the short-lived cameo, he's still making an extra $2K per year. Ventresca himself admits he was shocked by the residuals.</p><p>"Every time I get a cheque I think to myself: “Wow, they must be really rich"' he told The Guardian. 'I get about $2,000 a year in residuals, and I only did two episodes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/friends-wrote-an-episode-based-on-a-real-experience-that-took-place-with-the-cast-backstage.jpg> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-5.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Olivia Williams Reveals The Dark And Abusive Truth Of Working On Friends</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Olivia Williams guest starred in two episodes of Friends and shared that it was an awful experience.</span><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The supporting cast are still making thousands</a>, while the show continues to generate huge amounts of money all these years later.</p><h2 id=vincent-ventresca-admitted-things-were-completely-different-when-he-appeared-on-the-show-a-second-time>Vincent Ventresca Admitted Things Were Completely Different When He Appeared On The Show A Second Time</h2><p>Despite his limited appearances on the show, Vincent Ventresca has fond memories. He was asked by Today what it was like being on Friends. As expected, the actor had a blast. In addition, the actor that played Fun Bobby revealed things were completely different when he returned for a second time. The show had completely blown up.</p><p>He tells Today, “They were on the cover of Rolling Stone,” he recalled.</p><p>“It was pretty crazy. It was a circus. There were people everywhere. And I felt like the stakes were higher because we knew so much more about all of those characters and so much more about all of those actors. But they were sort of the same. They were just kind of doing their thing. And I just remember thinking, ‘That's cool.’ If they can sort of stay grounded and levelheaded throughout this process, this is going to be a good thing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fun-bobby-friends-.png> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ttweb_courteney-cox-admitted-she-was-upset-upon-realization-that-friends-had-altered-her-voice-during-certain-episodes_bk_a1_v3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Courteney Cox Admitted She Was Upset Upon Realization That Friends Had Altered Her Voice During Certain Episodes</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Courteney Cox revealed there are certain episodes of Friends she refuses to rewatch.</span><p>Being on Thursday nights was a big deal back then, according to Ventresca. However, the actor admitted that with streaming today, things have changed.</p><p>"I mean, it was a big deal. But that was 25 years ago. But then the show came out on Netflix, and so now all these kids that weren't even alive 25 years ago ... I'll go to the bagel store or something, and they'll be like, ‘Oh my God, there's Fun Bobby.’”</p><p>Not only did she enjoy a boost in fame from the show, but his experience also rekindled his passion for acting.</p><h2 id=vincent-ventresca-revealed-friends-rekindled-his-passion-for-acting>Vincent Ventresca Revealed Friends Rekindled His Passion For Acting</h2><p>Looking back at his best memories on-set, the actor is appreciative of how close the cast was behind the scenes. It was true a team atmosphere, something Ventresca resonated with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I was a basketball player when I was younger, and that's why I liked acting. They kind of made acting like sports again. It was a team. And they played it together and they worked together. And they knew what was funny and they used the audience as a way to kind of check if their instincts were right."</p><p>He continues, "And they knew if they could make the audience laugh they knew they'd make America laugh. Things didn't always go perfectly when you were taping the show — and they knew it. And they didn't just gloss over it. They were like, ‘Hey, we can do better.’ And then they literally would, like, huddle up in front of, like, a studio audience. And they'd be like, ‘What if you did this, or what if you did that? And let's try this.’ And they'd break, and then they'd go and do it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only was the show a success on-screen, but things were just as great behind the scenes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGitoqaTmru1edWepa2qlaiwonnFq6CeppSoerOx0qKbrpmcYr2ixY4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./this-is-what-shameless-star-emma-kenneys-love-life-looks-like-today.html>&#171;&nbsp;This Is What 'Shameless' Star, Emma Kenney's Love Life Looks Like Today</a>
