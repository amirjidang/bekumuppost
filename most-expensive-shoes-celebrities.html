array of options. They drop big bucks on everything from cars and mansions to meals and attire, there’s no game that’s too big to play. It seems that anything can be upgraded, and it’s possible to find a designer and exclusive version of anything. Accessories are a huge component of putting together the ultimate look, and shoes are no exception.</p><p>In fact, they’re the main feature. Men and women alike have the ability to select from the most outrageously designed and styled shoes. Some of these shoes feature diamonds and are worth more than you could ever imagine. It’s hard to imagine that the things you walk on could cost a fortune, but it becomes easier to understand when you examine the fine art and craftsmanship that went into designing them.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Most Expensive Gins, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=shoes-worth-one-million-dollars>Shoes Worth One Million Dollars!</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Laura Herring is one very, very lucky lady.

These finely detailed shoes are adorned with 464 sparkling Kwiat diamonds.</p><p>This diamond-type has become a statement signature for many of Weitzman’s designs. These are not simple to affix to a shoe, and as you can imagine, the labor required to design and create these shoes is nearly as expensive as the jewels that are on them. The coolest feature of this shoe – the straps are removable and can double as a necklace!</p><h2 id=big-boi-s-50-000-kicks>Big Boi's $50,000 Kicks</h2><p>Welcome to the shoe game!
