Unfortunately, there has not been a lot of information on this that's been made public. However, simply watching the show with an eye trained on the food reveals a lot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-10.jpg><p>Firstly, much of the food on Friends does appear to have been real. We know this because the actors are actually eating it on screen. However, not every time food is present in a scene does it get consumed. This is typical for movies and TV shows as it takes a long time to reset food between takes. Not to mention getting the continuity correct in the edit or simply making an actor way too full while they should be focusing on their lines and intentions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But, when re-watching Friends, it's clear that the likes of Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry, David Schwimmer, and Matt LeBlanc had to devour a few things, whether it was at a restaurant, muffins at Central Perk, pizza at Joey's, or a dinner at Monica's.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/A-scene-from-Friends-featuring-David-Schwimmer-Courteney-Cox-Matthew-Perry-Lisa-Kudrow-Matt-LeBlanc-and-Jennifer-Aniston-via-FilmAffinity.jpg><p>According to EveryMovieHasALesson, it's typical for actors not to fully consume all the real food on their plates. Due to having to shoot a scene multiple times, actors will often spit up their food into buckets so as not to eat too much.

Only she ends up accidentally combining two polar opposite recipes (a trifle and a shepherd's pie) and creates nothing short of a monstrosity. The concoction consisted of ladyfingers, jam, custard (made from scratch), raspberries, more ladyfingers, beef sautéed with peas and onions, a little more custard, sliced bananas, and whipped cream. Of course, Matt LeBlanc's Joey is the only one who actually likes the taste. The rest placate Rachel so as not to hurt her feelings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/friends-ross-rachel-and-joey.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While in some cases the food on sitcom sets is fake, this scene actually required the cast of Friends to eat something.
