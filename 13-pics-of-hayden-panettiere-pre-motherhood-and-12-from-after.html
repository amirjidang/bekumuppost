Hollywood. The celebrity has been in the acting business since before she was even a year old, and a lot has changed as the star has grown up in the spotlight.</p><p>Hayden is best known for her role as Claire Bennet in the NCB sci-fi series Heroes, which aired from 2006-2010. The star is also known for her current role as Juliette Barnesin on Nashville, which she has been reprising since 2012. Aside from these TV roles, Hayden has also starred in a variety of high-profile movies, including Remember The Titans (2000), Raising Helen (2004), Racing Stripes (2005), Ice Princess (2005), Bring It On: All or Nothing (2006), I Love You, Beth Cooper (2009), Scream 4 (2011), Custody (2016), and many more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from her acting roles, Hayden is also known for her busy personal life. The star’s dating life has been the subject of much speculation ever since she rose to fame in her mid-teens, and especially now that she’s become a mom. The star has been dating heavyweight world champion boxer Wladimir Klitschko since 2009, when they met at a book launch. The pair briefly split in 2011, citing long distance and hectic work schedules as the cause, but eventually reconciled in 2013. That same year, the couple announced their engagement, and Hayden gave birth to their daughter, Kaya, the following year in 2014. Hayden made headlines in 2015 and 2016 when she checked herself into rehab for post-partum depression, and has since been serving as an advocate for PPD awareness since.</p><p>Check out these photos which prove just how much life has changed for Hayden since becoming a mom! What surprises you the most?</p><h2 id=before-partying-it-up-with-paris>Before:&nbsp;Partying&nbsp;It Up With Paris</h2><p>Tons of celebrities have a past history of partying with the notorious Paris Hilton (we’re looking at you Kim K!), and it turns out Hayden is one of them. A quick Google search reveals tons of pictures of the two young blondes enjoying the Hollywood nightlife. And believe me, not all of the photos were tame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This photo is of Hayden during her teen years. Her early 2000s ‘do is a dead give away for the decade along with her brightly coloured sundress and turquoise earrings. No one would ever wear that clubbing nowadays! Paris also looked like a flashback from 15 years ago with her super short haircut and sheer purple dress. While this sight was pretty common in the early 2000s, Hayden has kissed goodbye to her days and nights of partying in favour of a more tame life as a fiancée and wife.</p><p>“You just have this freedom when you're younger - this lack of concern to fail or do anything wrong,” the actress has said about her infamous years of parting alongside Hollywood royalty. “It comes with an ease that I've found has kind of deteriorated over time.” We guess that’s why Paris and Hayden no longer hang out!</p><h2 id=after-making-headlines-for-the-right-reasons>After: Making Headlines For The Right Reasons</h2><p>Nowadays, Hayden doesn’t make headlines for partying with Paris Hilton, but rather for her adorable, small family. One of her most famous magazine shoots was her cover for People magazine where she posed with her newborn daughter Kaya and fiancée Wladimir. The issue published tons of adorable shots of the family to officially introduced the actress and professional boxer’s daughter to the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"She's really so sweet," Hayden told the magazine of her newborn. "I'm sure that's the way it's meant to be, because when they are putting you through the ringer you're like, 'You are lucky you're so cute!'” She continued, "You're suddenly looking at this little thing, like, 'Oh, that was you in my belly this whole time.'"</strong></p><p>Motherhood definitely looked like it was suiting Hayden in this issue. The celeb looked ethereal in an all-white casual, while her side braid gave the shoot a casual feel. Both her partner and baby were matching in all white outfits. Rather than glowing from sweat formed from going hard on the dance floor, the singer was glowing simply because she looked radiant and happy. The actress has said more than once how much motherhood changed her life for the better, and it definitely seems to be agreeing with her.</p><h2 id=before-spending-the-night-on-the-town>Before:&nbsp;Spending The Night On The Town</h2><p>Here’s an oldie but a goodie! This photo was taken right when Hayden and Wladimir began dating. It was clear just how much fun the couple have together as they chugged beer at a German festival (in full costume, might we add). Though they’ve always seemed like an odd pairing due to their striking height difference, it's clear that these two have been in love with each other for years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nowadays, rather than pose for paparazzi pictures with drinks, the two parents are often photographed spending time together with their daughter. Since giving birth to Kaya, reports have suggested that there may be trouble in paradise for these celebrity parents, but they continue to prove everyone wrong.</p><p><strong>“Hayden and Wladimir are in a good place and having a great time raising their daughter,” a source told People Magazine in the thick of break-up rumors in 2016.</strong></p><p>“Her previous problems were never with him. She is doing great, and they are very happy as a couple and family,” they added, referring to Hayden’s time in Rehab for postpartum depression following the birth of their daughter.&nbsp;Referring to a 2016 spotting at the beach as a family, the source continued, “They were together and very loving. They were holding hands, his arms were around her while they were watching the beginning of one of the art shows on the ceiling of the [Faena Art Dome on Miami Beach].”</p><h2 id=after-an-awards-show-for-date-night>After: An Awards Show For Date Night</h2><p>Nowadays, Hayden and Wladimir are spotted partying less often, and rather make turn their date nights into red carpet appearances, just like in this photo. The lovebirds are constantly showing up to events in support of one another, and fans can’t get over their adorableness.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans also can’t get over how much happier Hayden has seemed as of recently. The celeb has been open about her struggles with post-partum depression after having her daughter Kaya. She first sought treatment for&nbsp;it in October 2015, a year after giving birth. Hayden then checked herself into rehab a second time in 2016, revealing via Twitter that she needed more time to focus on healing herself.</p><p>"It takes you a while. You feel off. You don't feel like yourself," she told Good Morning America after her two rehab stints, as US Weekly reports. "But, you know, women are so resilient, and that's the incredible thing about them. I think I'm all the stronger for it. I think I'm a better mom because of it. Because you never take that connection for granted."</p><h2 id=before-living-life-in-the-fast-lane-with-lindsay>Before:&nbsp;Living Life In The Fast Lane With Lindsay</h2><p>Many fans were surprised- and also concerned- after photos of Hayden partying with the infamous Lindsay Lohan appeared online in 2008. The pics showed the actresses heavily intoxicated and partying into all hours of the morning. But what was more concerning was that LiLo was in the thick of her downward spiral, and many fans were worried Hayden may fall victim to the child actor curse, just like has so famously happened to Lindsay.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luckily, despite her once-famous partying streak, Hayden has managed to navigate growing up in Hollywood successfully. She never went overboard with the partying like some other former A-listers (ahem, Lindsay) nor was she arrested or had any troubling scandals. Hayden has repeatedly been outspoken about her distaste for the media, who she claims twists what really happens.</p><p><strong>“You go on these Internet blogs and people say the meanest things,” she once said in response to the backlash over photos showing her partying.</strong></p><p>“I'm a normal person. Just because I'm in the spotlight doesn't mean I'm God's gift to the world. I'm learning and making mistakes just like every other 17-year-old girl out there.” One of the greatest things about Hayden is that she isn’t afraid to be real and honest with the public- and we love it!</p><h2 id=after-family-time-sounds-like-a-great-time>After: Family Time Sounds Like A Great Time</h2><p>This was one of the first photos showing Hayden post-birth and her family’s newest addition. We’re used to seeing the blonde all dolled up on the red carpet in designer duds and jewelry, so it was refreshing to see her looking a bit more normal, for lack of a better word. The photo featured a make-up free Hayden with a messy hairstyle and an oversized sweatshirt. Rather than looking like an A-list celebrity, she looked like a normal, overworked mom, which we’re sure is how most celebs with kids look when they’re off the job!&nbsp;Hayden was very open with her fans about how difficult it was to bounce back after giving birth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"I'm limping around. I'm still trying to figure out what [pregnancy] has done to my body, how it's changed it. What's temporary and what's permanent,” she told People Magazine in her cover shoot announcing Kaya’s birth.</strong></p><p>"I feel like an 80-year-old woman trying to go down the stairs, you know, please tell me this is temporary. But I know some things will never be the same again."&nbsp;Luckily, the actress admits that her mother-in-law had been stepping up and helping with baby Kaya, so mom could get some rests. "Wlad's mom was desperate to take the baby for a night. She looks like she didn't get much sleep, but I feel well-rested!" she told the magazine. We all need a Grandma like that!</p><h2 id=before-questionable-things-happen-in-jacuzzis>Before: Questionable Things Happen in Jacuzzis</h2><p>Nowadays, you’d never find Hayden partying it up in a hot tub with a crowd of randoms, but the early 2000s were sure a different time. This decade-old pic shows a young, fresh-faced Hayden living her best life while partying with friends during one wild night. Pretty much everyone in the pic is in their swimsuits and has a drink in hand. This is a totally different Hayden from the one we know now!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hayden has previously discussed her difficulties with growing up in the spotlight. The star has lived literally her whole life in front of a camera- her first acting gig, a commercial, came at the tender age of 11. The actress is the first to admit that she had a wild streak and could be found partying with Hollywood’s wildest (which explains her selfies with Paris and Lindsay). But, luckily it seems that the star has learned and grown a lot from her wild younger years.</p><p>“People can tell when you're happy with being you and when you're not,” Hayden once said about maturing and growing up. “It's only cheesy because it's true. As I've gotten older and grown into my body, I've started realizing that the way you carry yourself and that light coming out of your eyes are the most attractive things about you.”</p><h2 id=after-pretty-polished-and-put-together>After: Pretty, Polished, and Put-Together</h2><p>Hayden has a totally new persona and style since becoming a mother. This photo from a televised interview shows just how much the star’s fashion sense has changed in the past few years. Hayden’s power pink pantsuit was both trendy and conservative but in a fashion-forward way. She’s gone from posing in barely anything on the red carpet to rocking chic pantsuits and button-downs. It’s not that the star has lost her carefree sense of style. Rather, it appears she’s refined her style and found what works for her&nbsp;during this stage of her life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Nashville star once said that her fashion choices are influenced by the phase she’s going through in life, and we can totally see how motherhood has been influencing her choices.</p><p><strong>“I've always described my taste in fashion and music as being very eclectic and uniquely based off my feelings that day,” Hayden once explained. “That's the wonderful thing about style. You can be whatever you want to be. You can describe yourself however you want to describe yourself.”</strong></p><p>Fans have definitely noticed a different approach to Hayden’s outfit choices since becoming a mom, with the star choosing more sophisticated looks on the red carpet and casual outfits for days off. Are you a fan of her recent style choices?</p><h2 id=before-the-shorter-the-dress-the-higher-the-heel>Before: The Shorter The Dress, The Higher The Heel</h2><p>Here’s an example of how Hayden used to dress before becoming a momma. True to early 2000s style, the star showed up to a red carpet event in a mini, leopard print dress. The cocktail dress showed off her petite frame, while her sky-high nude heels made her legs appear longer and toned. The actress, who is known for her long, blonde locks, was also showing off a fresh, short ‘do that complemented her square jawline.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though the actress has long been revered as a Hollywood bombshell, it turns out she has her insecurities just like the rest of us. Hayden has never been afraid to talk about her least favorite physical features and her long journey to body positivity.</p><p><strong>“I don't have a model's body,” the star once admitted. “But I'm not one of those crazy girls who </strong>thinks<strong> that they're fat. I'm okay with what I have. I can rock this body, you know?”</strong></p><p>She’s also added that she loves putting her best foot forward since it makes her feel the best in her body. “Every girl likes feeling hot and sexy and beautiful and likes hearing it,” she added.&nbsp;We love that Hayden isn’t afraid to be open about her challenge to accepting herself- it proves that even celebrities have insecurities, too!</p><h2 id=after-mama-knows-how-to-rock-a-power-suit>After: Mama Knows How To&nbsp;Rock A Power Suit</h2><p>Hayden looked like an absolute boss when she showed up to a press event in this fashion-forward power suit. Her matching pantsuit featured a dark floral design that was both fresh and had a bit of an edgy twist. She kept the look business-chic with her thick-rimmed glasses, smart handbag, and sky-high stilettos. This look is proof that Hayden has kissed her days of leopard print cocktail dresses goodbye in favor of a more polished style. And we are living for it!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although we think Hayden’s frame look as rocking as ever (this picture is total proof), the star has had a long road to getting back to her pre-baby weight. Right after giving birth to her daughter, sources said the celeb was anxious to hit the gym and start dieting, even though her fiancée was encouraging her to take things slow.</p><p>“[Wladimir] wants her to take her time and wishes she’s start in February instead, but he’s made her promise to do it slowly and gradually,” a source told OK Magazine at the time. The insider went on, “He’s an expert in body recovery and believes she should take seven to nine months to lose it.” They added that Wladimir was putting together a special post-partum diet and workout plan to help her reach her goal weight. How supportive!</p><h2 id=before-she-was-a-teenage-drama-queen>Before: She Was A Teenage Drama Queen</h2><p>To say that Hayden grew up in Hollywood would be an understatement. The actress has lived her entire life in the spotlight after starring in her first commercial at only 11 months old. It didn’t take the bubbly blonde long to start scoring bigger roles, and it catapulted her into fame even before she was a teenager. This photo shows just how young Hayden was when she was at the height of her fame. Her tiny black outfits, America-themed skates, and party tiara are a far cry from the sophisticated actress that we know today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"I'm no different to anyone else,” the celeb said on BBC Breakfast in 2013 about growing up in Hollywood and being compared to troubled child stars like Lindsay Lohan and Amanda Bynes.</strong></p><p>“And those same doors were opened to me and they were very easy to walk through—drugs, alcohol, being in inappropriate places where you shouldn't be at a certain age—it's a very tough position to be in, but I had great people to pull me back from it."&nbsp;The star has credited a strong support system consisting of friends and family as well as having a straight head on her shoulders to being able to steer clear of the ‘temptations’ of Hollywood. Given how great her life seems to be going now, we’d say she’s done good!</p><h2 id=after-now-she-s-on-full-time-mom-duty>After: Now She's On Full-Time Mom Duty</h2><p>Hayden looked like a total natural as she was seen walking with her mini-me daughter Kaya. The mother-daughter duo was dressed in matching outfits, with the actress styled in a red top and jeans and her little one in a red shirt and patterned leggings. The star kept her head down and her daughter close to her as she navigated the paparazzi, who were trying desperately to get a close-up shot of Kaya’s face (since Hayden and Wladimir are both very private when it comes to photos of her).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since her double rehab stints for ppd in 2015 and 2016, Hayden has been incredibly open about her experience with the public.</p><p><strong>"It helped me identify and let women know that it's OK to ask for </strong>help,<strong> and that it's OK to have a moment of weakness, and it doesn't make you a bad person — it doesn't make you a bad mother,” she told Good Morning America. “It makes you a very strong, resilient woman. You got to let it make you stronger."</strong></p><p>Hayden continued, "You just reprioritise, and you hear that they're healthy and you don't care about yourself anymore. I mean, it's the most out of body experience where you go, 'I will completely lay myself on the line for my child,' without even a hesitation."</p><h2 id=before-making-a-very-memorable-entrance>Before: Making A (Very) Memorable Entrance</h2><p>Hayden has had her fair share of embarrassing pictures be published by the paparazzi, including this hilarious shot showing her struggling to walk to a red carpet event. Many fans have accused her of looking intoxicated in this series of photos, while others suggest that maybe her heels were just difficult to walk in. Either way, the combination of Hayden’s tacky cocktail dress, oversized blazer (which could have totally been her boyfriend’s), and her peep-toe booties, this is one outfit and entrance we bet the star wishes she could erase. Hey, the early 2000s were a struggle for everyone!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"Being a young female growing up in the industry is tough,” the actress told BBC Breakfast about growing up in Hollywood. “I grew up in the generation of the wild child—I was guilty by association. So everyone sits there and waits for you to fall off your horse.”</strong></p><p>She continued, “But as long as you have people who are willing to tell you the truth and are not afraid to tell you the truth and give you a reality check—it makes a world of difference.” Nowadays, Hayden is a lot more polished and put-together on the red carpet, which is a tell-tale sign that this former child star is all grown up.</p><h2 id=after-she-s-got-a-date-for-life>After: She's Got A Date For Life</h2><p>While Hayden used to be known for (literally) stumbling into red carpet events, now she walks into them with her fine looking fiancée on her arm. Hayden and Wladimir have been together since 2009, and the couple still looks like they’re stronger than ever. Just like in this photo, the pair is always happy to smile for a photo opportunity at red carpet events. Likewise, the couple is always showing up to events to support one another in their careers. How cute!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“I can’t say that anything is typical or ‘the norm’ about any day of the week now that I’m the mom of a 2-year-old,” Hayden told Parade Magazine last year about what her life is like nowadays.</strong></p><p>“She gets her hands in just about everything, and my biggest job at the moment is keeping her alive!” The celeb continued by adding that becoming a mom showed her who was truly there for her. “Then I went through a pregnancy and I found out who my true friends were — the ones that were going to stick around and support me,” she explained. “I’ll just say the outcome was slim pickins!”</p><p>Luckily, Hayden added that Wladimir had only been amazing since the birth of their daughter. Talk about couple goals!</p><h2 id=before-a-glamorous-golden-goddess>Before: A Glamorous, Golden Goddess</h2><p>There’s no denying that Hayden was stunning before and after having a baby! This photo shows just how gorgeous she is. For a red carpet event, the actress stunned in a sparkly, silver dress that hugged her slim figure. She wore her locks in vintage-inspired waves, while the bleach blonde color complimented her fresh, bronzed tan. It’s not hard to see why Wladimir fell head over heels so quickly for the American actress- just take a look at this photo if you have any doubts!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I love to do movies. That's something that I find so much joy in, in being able to travel around and play new characters,” Hayden has said about why she’s stayed in the acting business for so long, considering that many former child actors retire when they hit adulthood.</p><p>However, the star has also never been shy to discuss the downsides of life in Hollywood. “Life is like a lunchroom at school,” she once said about being in the business. “In this industry, you've got little individual tables of actors, singers, rap stars, this, that, the other. But it's a big industry that also encompasses anyone in the public eye.” Despite the difficulties of navigating Hollywood, Hayden clearly has her strategy perfected.</p><h2 id=after-fashion-isn-t-her-top-priority-anymore>After: Fashion Isn't Her Top Priority Anymore</h2><p>Especially during her pregnancy and right after giving birth, Hayden was ridiculed for some of her outfit choices, with fans saying she looked frumpy and un-celeb like (whatever that means). This outfit, in particular, got some of the worst backlash. Hayden dressed her burgeoning baby bump in a geisha-inspired shirt that did little to flatter her petite frame. Her makeup-free face and quick hairstyle didn’t help her unflattering look. It didn’t take long for the Internet trolls to attack Hayden once these pics were published.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like many working moms, Hayden has admitted her priorities have changed since becoming a mother. Nowadays, she can’t be as concerned with fashion and how she looks as she once was- and who can blame her! “Juggling my workload and being a mom right now is plenty,” Hayden told Parade Magazine about whether she’s planning any big career moves after becoming a mom. “I’ve figured out my own limits over the years, and music is a bridge that I might want to cross when I can truly dedicate myself to it,” she added.</p><p>All moms know that you can’t always look 100 percent put together at all times, so hopefully, the haters will give Hayden a break. Even on her worst days, she still looks better than most of us!</p><h2 id=before-the-less-clothes-the-better>Before:&nbsp;The Less Clothes The Better</h2><p>Hayden got quite the wrap in her early 20s for wearing as little clothing as possible. Whether she was out partying with Paris Hilton or attending a movie premiere, the star’s rule seemed to be that less is more. This cringe-worthy outfit is one of those times where Hayden stepped out in little to nothing. Her plunging neckline left little to the imagination, while her gold purse strap acted as an odd necklace-like accessory. There’s no doubt that Hayden looked steamy in this fashion-forward outfit, but this is more out-there of a look than we’re used to seeing her in nowadays.&nbsp;When Hayden announced her pregnancy, she got a bit of backlash for her young age – she was only 24 at the time! But the celeb defended her decision to start a family:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“I don't really have a plan. I've lived a very big life, and I don't feel my age, and I feel like I was born to be a mother,” she said.</strong></p><p>Hayden has always been open about the fact that she likes to be adventurous and spontaneous, which may explain why her pregnancy was an unexpected but very exciting surprise. “I'm actually kind of more adventurous,” she has said. “I like to go out on the floors and try to be incognito. Because it's more fun to be out there. So - when people do recognize you it's a little bit scarier.”</p><h2 id=after-her-style-has-never-been-better>After: Her Style Has Never Been Better</h2><p>To be honest, we think that Hayden’s style has never been better since becoming a mom. The actress looks more sophisticated and pulled-together nowadays and is picking outfits that are more fashion-forward rather than scandalous. This outfit, in particular, shows just how great the celeb mom’s style is. Her red and black mini dress showed off some serious skin with its short hemline, but the long sleeves balanced it out. Hayden’s classy black heels and sleek, straight hairstyle added to this polished look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources say the actress has been focusing on herself more since her two rehab stints- and it seems like that includes focusing on her personal style! “She is trying to take care of herself. She wanted to get herself healthy again,” a source told People Magazine around the time Hayden checked herself into rehab for the second time. They added, “The postpartum has been really scary for everybody, but she’s taking care of it. She’s taking care of herself.”</p><p>We’re so glad to hear that Hayden is putting her health first, which is the most important thing she can do for herself and her family. Even more, we love that she’s not afraid to talk about her experiences and use her platform as a way to help others who may be going through similar things. Keep slaying, girl!</p><h2 id=before-walking-the-red-carpet-every-weekend>Before: Walking The Red Carpet Every Weekend</h2><p>Back before she was a mom, it seemed like Hayden was hitting up the red carpet every weekend. There was always some premiere or party she was attending, and every time she showed off her incredible sense of style. In this photo, the star looked like a real-life Greek Goddess in a sparkly, white dress that draped at the waist. Hayden’s bright red lipstick and sleek hairstyle added to the glamorous vibes she was giving off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the fact that Hayden always seemed like she was everywhere in the early 2000s, the celeb once said looks can be deceiving. Back in 2008, the star said she barely had a social life due to her hectic work schedule.</p><p><strong>“I don’t ever go out,” she told The Mirror, adding that she avoids going out in public so as not to be recognized. “I stay at home. I go from garage to garage, and keep myself out of sight.”</strong></p><p>The celeb continued, “I love where I live and that I have wonderful friends there and I love what I do, but it really has a major impact on your life. This business is very intrusive.” She went on, “People want to know what you’re doing every day, and it becomes less about your craft and your art, and your love for acting, than it is about when you put food in your mouth, or when you’re walking your dog.”</p><h2 id=after-now-family-time-takes-priority>After: Now Family Time Takes Priority</h2><p>While we were once used to seeing Hayden only at red carpet events and parties, we’re now more likely to see the star enjoying a casual day out with her family. This is one of many photos showing the star and her baby daddy stepping out in the months after Kaya’s birth. Hayden looked dressed-down in a neon puffer coat and jeans, while Vladimir rocked sweats as he carried their daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was only a year after Kaya’s birth that Hayden decided to enter rehab for her post-partum depression, and another year after that is when she checked in for a second time. What she wrote on Twitter: “The postpartum depression I have been experiencing has impacted every aspect of my life,” the actress wrote on Twitter when she announced she’d be going back to rehab once again.</p><p><strong>“Rather than stay stuck due to unhealthy coping mechanisms I have chosen to take time to reflect holistically on my health and life. Wish me luck!”</strong></p><p>Though the star has received her fair share of hate for choosing to seek treatment for her depression, she has always been met with tons of praise and encouragement from those who commend her for sharing her experience. Hayden is undoubtedly helping others in similar situations seek help, which is awesome in our books!</p><h2 id=before-cocktail-dresses-and-fancy-events>Before: Cocktail Dresses and Fancy Events</h2><p>Hayden looked angelic in this golden outfit, which she rocked to a red carpet event in the early 2000s. The light beige colour of her dress complimented her bronzed skin, while her golden hair looked chic in the loose bun. Hayden finished the stylish looked with gold accessories and a matching clutch. We seriously want the number of her stylist because this look is on fire!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite her undeniable good looks, Hayden has admitted that landing roles has been tough for her sometimes since she often gets cast as the same character.</p><p><strong>"Playing such a specific role — young, female, all-American cheerleader — you definitely tend to get typecast,” the star once explained during a 2007 press conference.</strong></p><p>She continued, "I think I've always been categorized, and sometimes typecast, because I'm blonde, and people look at me as either the popular cheerleader type or just the blonde, and you don't play villains when you're blonde, unless you're Sharon Stone.” Despite being typecast as the typical blonde, we think Hayden has still managed to have a pretty successful career in Hollywood. From success as a child actress to her current role in Nashville, Hayden has sure managed to navigate typecasts and remain relevant throughout the years.</p><h2 id=after-family-vacations-out-of-the-spotlight>After: Family Vacations Out Of The Spotlight</h2><p>Rather than hitting up red carpet events and parties all the time, Hayden nowadays seems more content spending quality time with her family. In this recent photo, Hayden enjoyed a beach day with her fiancée and daughter, and looked completely happy while doing it. The actress has said she’s been doing much better (and feeling a lot happier) since her last rehab visit in 2016, and these photos are proof that she’s looking better than ever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was always so terrified that people weren't going to accept me," Hayden told Yahoo! Style about deciding to seek treatment for her PPD. "I finally just went, 'I'm tired of living afraid. I'm tired of living in fear of what people are going to think, so you know, I'm just going to put it all out there on the table and I'm not going to worry about the judgment.'"</p><p>She added that things are much better for her nowadays. "Now I’m the mother of a 2-year-old, I’ve found my pack of solid, loyal, lifelong friends here and am settled into a beautiful routine," she told Parade Magazine. "Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a blast. My life and who I am have simply evolved in a beautiful way."</p><h2 id=before-she-was-best-friends-with-paris>Before: She Was Best Friends&nbsp;With Paris</h2><p>It seems like it was entirely different Universe when Hayden was best friends with Paris Hilton. Just like in this photo, it wasn’t uncommon to see the two blondes strolling the streets of California shopping, or partying it up in uncompromising pictures. Nowadays, we can’t recall the last time Paris and Hayden were in the same photo (who even knows if they talk anymore), but luckily the photos are proof that will last forever.&nbsp;Hayden is aware that, for a time, she had a bad wrap in the media for her association to Paris.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“I’ve known Paris since I was 13,” she told Celebs Now about her friendship with the infamous socialite. “At 15, I did </strong>party<strong> with her, but I was just doing what every teenage girl does.”</strong></p><p>Still, Hayden only had nice things to say about her former friend. “Paris is a very nice person and a lot brighter than people give her credit for – she’s a marketing genius,” she added.&nbsp;Clearly, Hayden’s friend circle has changed since she became a mom. But who knows, maybe she and Paris will be hanging out soon once again! Given that Paris just got engaged (and has always been open about wanting to have kids), it's not that implausible.</p><h2 id=after-now-her-time-is-spent-with-family>After: Now Her Time Is Spent With Family</h2><p>Clearly, the most important people in Hayden’s life nowadays is her fiancée and her adorable daughter. Rather than being photographed hanging out with Hollywood’s elites and strutting her stuff on the red carpet, it is more common to find Hayden posting pics of her and her family to Instagram and taking cute family vacations together. This lovely black and white shot of Hayden’s little family from Insta is definitely one of their sweetest together!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“Motherhood is the most beautiful, exciting thing, and there's nothing that I feel like I can't accomplish while having children in my life,” Hayden has said about motherhood.</strong></p><p>She added that she’s not going to slow down her career just because she’s a mom- though she’s open to taking some time off! “I would sacrifice having more years of being wherever I want whenever I want for years with my kids.”&nbsp;As of now, there’s no word on when or if Hayden and Wladimir are planning on expanding their family. Given how adorable their first born is, we’d love to see these two have more babies. And given how much Hayden seems to be loving motherhood, we definitely don’t see having more kids being far off in the future. What do you think?</p><h2 id=before-going-all-out-with-her-girls>Before: Going All Out With Her Girls</h2><p>There are tons of crazy photos showing just how hard Hayden used to party before she became a mom. This picture shows the celeb posing for a goofy shot with some of her girlfriends during what looks like a fun night on the town. Hayden looked casual in a plaid button-down shirt and grey jacket. But she and her friends sure looked like they were having a good time as they piled into the car and made silly faces for the camera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“I grew up with the Lindsay Lohans and the Paris Hiltons,” Hayden told US Weekly.</strong></p><p>She was talking about being compared to other young celebs who were constantly making headlines for the wrong reasons, and the pressure she felt not to make the same mistakes.</p><p><strong>“I was in the same generation. I was expected to do the exact same thing. I was watched like a hawk to not fall into the same groove, and I fought against that for so long,” she continued.</strong></p><p>Even though it’s clear Hayden used to love having a fun night out (and who doesn’t?!), she was luckily able to steer clear of some of the other things former celeb stars got into. Keeping being you, girl!</p><p>Sources: <a href=#>OK Magazine,</a><a href=#>Brainy Quotes</a>, <a href=#>E!
