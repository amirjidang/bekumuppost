And, most recently, the co-creators of the show revealed who was the inspiration for TBBT’s most iconic character: Sheldon Cooper.

And when Jim Parsons came in, he was Sheldon on a level. You know, there were people who came in and you went, 'Okay, well, he's kind of okay,' 'Oh, he's pretty good,' 'Maybe he's the guy,' [but] Jim came in, and he was just – from that audition, he was the Sheldon that you saw on television. Jim left the room, and I turned and I went, 'That's the guy! That's the guy! That's the guy!'" Bill Prady told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">People</a>.</p><p>But, believe it or not, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Chuck Lorre didn’t want to cast Parsons</a> as Sheldon at first.

I would tell Chuck [Lorre] about a guy I knew who was a human calculator. If you programmed in Z80 assembly you had to convert from decimal to hexadecimal, and you could either grab the calculator or you could shout it to this guy, and he would be faster."</p><p>"But he couldn’t calculate a tip at a restaurant. And the reason is because the formula for a tip is 15-20% depending upon the quality of the service, and he couldn’t put a numeric value on the service. It was human.”</p><p>And as for the names of the show’s two main characters, Chuck Lorre has revealed that Sheldon Cooper and Leonard Hofstadter are named in honor of actor, writer, and producer Sheldon Leonard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki And Kaley Cuoco Are Still Making Millions For The Big Bang Theory Thanks To Reruns</a></span></p><h2 id=jim-parsons-rsquo-nephew-inspired-chuck-lorre-to-create-young-sheldon>Jim Parsons’ Nephew Inspired Chuck Lorre To Create Young Sheldon</h2><p>Turns out that Jim Parsons, who played Sheldon Cooper in The Big Bang Theory for 12 seasons, accidentally inspired Chuck Lorre to create the spin-off series, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Young Sheldon</a>, that follows a nine-year-old Sheldon Cooper trying to adapt to life in East Texas.</p><p>“The beginning was a phone call from Jim Parsons, who sent me a video of his 10-year-old nephew in Texas who is a prodigy — brilliant, extraordinary, off the hook, crazy smart kid.
