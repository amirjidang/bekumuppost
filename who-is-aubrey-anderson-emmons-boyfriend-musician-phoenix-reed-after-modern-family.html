From visiting her Instagram account, it's clear that Aubrey Anderson-Emmons is loving life. She spent so many years starring on a hit show and seems to be enjoying taking some time for herself. And that includes enjoying time with her boyfriend. Who is Aubrey Anderson-Emmons's partner Phoenix Reed? What can fans find out about their relationship?</p><h2 id=aubrey-anderson-emmons-has-been-dating-phoenix-reed-since-at-least-2022>Aubrey Anderson-Emmons Has Been Dating Phoenix Reed Since At Least 2022</h2><p>Many Modern Family cast members have fallen in love or committed to a partner in the years after the series finale aired. Sarah Hyland married Wells Adams in the summer of 2022. Ariel Winter began a relationship with Luke Benward in 2019 that seems to be really serious now. And Aubrey Anderson-Emmons has love in her life as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In January 2022, Kiss.ie reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aubrey Anderson-Emmons was dating Phoenix Reed</a>. The actress shared a photo of her and Reed grinning at each other on Instagram. She wrote in the caption, "Favorite boy."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/phoenix-reed-aubrey-anderson-emmons.jpg><p>While it's unclear when this relationship actually began, it seems that they have been a couple since at least the beginning of 2022.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things Aubrey Anderson Has Done Since 'Modern Family'</a></span></p><p>Even though the Modern Family star hasn't acted since the emotional sitcom finale aired in 2020, she seems to love posting on Instagram. And she doesn't go many days without posting a new photo for her fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And Phoenix Reed is a staple on Aubrey Anderson-Emmons's Instagram. On November 1st, 2022, the couple posted photos from Halloween, and it was fun to see their cool costumes. In early October 2022, she posted some photos of the two of them hanging out and captioned them "weekend."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/aubrey-anderson-emmons-2.jpg><p>On February 14th 2023, Reed posted a photo with Anderson-Emmons and wrote, "Happy Valentine's Day to my soulmate." The previous summer, he shared a photo of them kissing and wrote "I love you" in the caption. And he also shared that they went to Disneyland in September 2022.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Ariel Winter Really Felt About Working With Sofia Vergara On Modern Family</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Anderson-Emmons and Reed are keeping their romance private, they aren't shy about how much they love each other. Reed's Instagram bio includes Anderson-Emmons's name and a heart emoji next to it.</p><p>This seems to be the first relationship that the actress has been in. Or, at the very least, it's the only time that she has publicly shared that she has a boyfriend. However, since she is only 16 years old and began acting on Modern Family when she was just a kid, it seems likely that this is the first time that she has been in love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aubrey-anderson-emmons-secretly-dated-musician-phoenix-reed-after-her-modern-family-fame-here-s-the-truth-about-their-mysterious-relationship-2.jpg><p>Modern Family fans love seeing the actress so happy. And everyone is definitely gushing over how old Anderson-Emmons seems, at least when compared to her early days on Modern Family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yahoo! reported that when Jesse Tyler Ferguson shared that he was hanging out with Anderson-Emmons in 2022, Sarah Hyland wrote on the Instagram post, "I CAN NOT. @aubreyandersonemmons IS A FULL ON GROWN UP AND I CAN'T HANDLE IT!!"</p><p>Perhaps so little is known about the couple because Anderson-Emmons isn't acting right now. If she was talking to the press a lot to promote a new TV show or movie, she might be asked about Reed. But unless she begins to act again, she and her boyfriend might continue to stay quiet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/aubrey-anderson-emmons.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's possible that the actress has been contacted for interviews in the time since the end of Modern Family. Everyone wants to know how she feels about the popular sitcom and what her schedule looks like now that she's no longer playing Lily.</p><p>But while she hasn't been talking to the media, she has been posting a lot online. Anderson-Emmons and her mother Amy Anderson started a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel called FoodMania</a>.</p><p>While they haven't posted recently, they shared a few videos and discussed the food that they were eating. In one video, they talked about the Koreatown neighborhood of Los Angeles. In another, they talked about candy that a fan living in Finland wanted them to try.</p><h2 id=who-is-aubrey-anderson-emmons-39-s-boyfriend-phoenix-reed>Who Is Aubrey Anderson-Emmons's Boyfriend Phoenix Reed?</h2><p>Phoenix Reed is a musician who is part of the band Skinless Bastards.
