When he <a href=#>poured his heart and soul into The Fabelmans</a>, his biographical drama that was released in 2022, fans were excited to learn more about his upbringing.</p><p>While Steven Spielberg has made many family-friendly movies throughout his career, he is also someone who seems totally devoted to his own home life. The <strong>director and his wife Kate Capshaw</strong><strong>have seven kids </strong>who range in age from 26 to 47. Growing up with a legendary director for a father can't be easy all the time. Sure, there are always going to be certain perks, but it can be tough when a parent is away filming a movie frequently.

In 2020, she told The Sun that she had experienced mistreatment "from outside my family."

However, in a video Q&A with People, Capshaw did mention that she loves E.T.</p><p>But while Steven Spielberg's fans might wonder if his seven kids have strong opinions about his celebrity status, they haven't said anything to indicate that they were unhappy with their upbringing.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/julia-roberts-steven-spielberg-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Real Reason Steven Spielberg Refuses To Work With Julia Roberts</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>After working on Hook together, Spielberg and Roberts have steered clear of one another.</span><p>Although Spielberg's children don't seem to have given interviews sharing their thoughts on what he's like as a dad, the director has talked about being a caring and hands-on father.
