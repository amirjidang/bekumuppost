The <strong>director and his wife Kate Capshaw</strong><strong>have seven kids </strong>who range in age from 26 to 47. Growing up with a legendary director for a father can't be easy all the time. Sure, there are always going to be certain perks, but it can be tough when a parent is away filming a movie frequently.
