However, the backpacks that carry <a href=#>some books on the shelf </a>and school supplies are long gone because the ones people have these days are more elevated in style, with designs that are perfect for adults without them looking like a lost child. Not only that, but they're also interchangeable with other bags, making them a staple accessory in anyone's wardrobe or even <a href=#>Lady Gaga's insane wardrobe</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, more and more upscale designers are releasing backpacks that use sophisticated fabrics, leather, and intricate accessories to elevate their bags' style without compromising their function. These designer backpacks have deep pockets and sturdy casings to ensure their contents' safety. That being said, they also come with a very hefty price tag. Curious to see which designer backpacks made it to the list? Read more below to find out!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>These Are The 10 Most Expensive Starbucks Drinks In The World</a></span></p><h2 id=brunello-cucinelli-leisure-backpack>Brunello Cucinelli Leisure Backpack</h2><p>The Brunello Cucinelli Leisure Backpack is starting this list strong, which costs an incredible $3,995. Although it's designed to carry stuff, its lightweight material and design came from cotton and linen canvas, combined with vintage calfskin leather and water-resistant coating to help protect the backpack from usual wear-and-tear scenarios. Made in the Italian hamlet of Solomeo, and with the expensive price tag, people might want to choose another backpack to take with them if they plan to go hiking or take their kids on regular field trips.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chanel-calfskin-amp-silver-tone-metal-backpack>Chanel Calfskin & Silver-Tone Metal Backpack</h2><p>Chanel is a brand known for crafting some of the most beautiful designer stuff in the world. With a track record of creating apparel, shoes, handbags, and perfume, it's no secret that they're making their version of the designer backpack. The Chanel Calfskin & Silver-Tone Metal Backpack is made entirely from calfskin and stitched together to create the ribbed texture. Although it is not as expensive as <a href=#>some of the most expensive Hermes bags ever sold</a>, it is still priced high at $4,500. In addition, the bag is lined with waterproof fabric that helps protect the things inside from moisture. This backpack was made for lounging around and sitting still for a high price.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chanel-grained-calfskin-amp-gold-tone-metal-backpack>Chanel Grained Calfskin & Gold-Tone Metal Backpack</h2><p>Another backpack included on this list is from Chanel but costs a little more than the previous item. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chanel Grained Calfskin & Gold-Tone Metal</a> bag costs $4,700, has a smooth texture, and the flaps boast the brand's famous interlocked Cs. The backpack is also lined with water-resistant fabric, and despite its smaller size, it's roomy inside. This makes it the perfect accessory to use when going to work or taking a stroll in the city. But, of course, keeping this backpack out of rowdy children's reach would be best given the expensive price tag.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=santiago-gonzalez-caiman-crocodile-backpack>Santiago Gonzalez Caiman Crocodile Backpack</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Santiago Gonzalez Caiman Crocodile Backpack </a>isn't the most expensive item on this list, but it is quite a luxury item. If the price tag of over $5,550 isn't enough to make it stand out, then knowing that it's made out of actual Colombian crocodile skin might make it more appealing. Designed by Santiago Gonzalez, son of another legendary designer, Nancy Gonzalez, this backpack is marketed toward men who have a taste for the finer things in life. This is why the design includes straps that people can interchange, allowing the customer to use it for crossbody wear.</p><h2 id=louis-vuitton-x-fragment-zack-backpack-with-monogram-eclipse-in-black>Louis Vuitton x Fragment Zack Backpack with Monogram Eclipse in Black</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This backpack designed by Louis Vuitton is one of the most hyped-up and expensive bags across the globe. Seeing as Louis Vuitton is the top luxury brand in the world which is a <a href=#>brand loved my many celebrities</a>, this item has a price tag of $5,600. The design itself is made to be durable for everyday use, with a combination of leather and mesh to withstand heavy objects and enhance the breathability of the items placed inside. The trademark monogram is recognizable, making sure that whoever sees this backpack will know that it's authentic.</p><h2 id=brunello-cucinelli-fox-fur-backpack-with-precious-flap>Brunello Cucinelli Fox Fur Backpack With Precious Flap</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another design by Brunello Cucinelli makes it to the list of the most expensive backpacks in the world. The Fox Fur Backpack with the Precious Flap design costs a staggering $5,995, and with the authentic fox fur design, makes it incredibly soft to the touch. The back part, flaps, and the straps are made from matte calfskin provides a stark contrast to the fluff that surrounds the item. The bag even comes with a small mirror, perfect for checking appearances while the owner&nbsp;drinks wines&nbsp;and dines at <a href=#>the most expensive restaurant in Paris</a>.</p><h2 id=chanel-shearling-lambskin-backpack>Chanel Shearling Lambskin Backpack</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another design by Chanel squeezes itself into the list, making it the third-most expensive backpack in the world. The Chanel Shearling Lambskin Backpack costs a whopping $6,500, and is made out of actual lambskin. The luxury item is handsewn to make the iconic diamond pattern, with gold-toned metal accents, and satin lining that will help keep the items inside safe from damage. Its small stature is perfect for keeping smaller, everyday accessories, such as wallets, phones, makeup and power banks. With the hefty price tag, the owner needs to make sure that the item is properly taken care of.</p><h2 id=louis-vuitton-x-supreme-christopher-backpack-epi-pm-black>Louis Vuitton x Supreme Christopher Backpack Epi PM Black</h2><p><a href=#>Luxury brand designer Louis Vuitton</a> and skateboarding store brand, Supreme, teamed up to make this incredible backpack design come true.

Made out of durable Epi leather, the bag has roomy space and several interior pockets perfect for stuffing various items inside.

This item is made out of genuine cowhide, as evidenced by its dark brown color. The trademark LV logo makes the distinctive pattern recognizable to anyone who looks at it. The bag also has a special pocket inside, specifically designed for iPads, to make carrying tablets easier without fear of it getting damaged.</p><h2 id=louis-vuitton-christopher-pm-crocodile-mat>Louis Vuitton Christopher PM Crocodile Mat</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, the most expensive backpack in the world goes to Louis Vuitton again, with their Christopher PM Crocodile Mat. This item is priced at an astounding $81,500, which is roughly the cost of a luxury car, or a small house. It is also steeper than some of the world's most expensive birthstones. The backpack's defining feature is that it's made out of premium-quality crocodile skin, and it is entirely hand-sewn, too. Though it doesn't gain any brownie points from PETA, the backpack is extremely rare to come across these days.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;</span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Most Expensive</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wealthy Gorilla</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thread Curve</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbHSnmSaqpViwamxjGpnZqWfqMFusdepnKermauybq7AnKKpmZOgwG61zWaroZ1drLyzuMNo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./travis-kelces-brother-jason-red-flags-taylor-swift-ex-girlfriends-maya-benberry-kayla-nicole-warning.html>&#171;&nbsp;Travis Kelces Brother Says Taylor Swift Has Red Flags, While His Exes Warn Her To Be Careful</a>
