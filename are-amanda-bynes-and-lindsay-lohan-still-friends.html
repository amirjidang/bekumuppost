The two actresses reigned throughout the 90s and 2000s appearing in hit movies such as 'The Parent Trap', 'Freaky Friday', 'What A Girl Wants', and 'Easy A'. It was evident that Lohan and Bynes were not only one another's competition at the time, but also shared a friendship!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While things have certainly changed, so much so that Amanda Bynes has officially retired from acting&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">following her 2012 breakdown</a>, all while Lohan is focusing on her newest jewelry collection.

The two actors have been in the limelight for most of their lives, and have gone down what many fans have called a "similar path". Amanda first began her television career with Nickelodeon back in 1999 as the face of her very own sketch comedy show, 'The Amanda Show'. Lohan began to gain immense notoriety as an actress only a year prior to Bynes' debut, appearing in the hit film, 'The Parent Trap', alongside Dennis Quaid and the late Natasha Richardson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It did not take much time before Lindsay and Amanda were at the height of their careers. Amanda scored herself a series of successful films, including 'What A Girl Wants', and became the lead star of her own Warner Brothers television show, 'What I Like About You', starring Bynes and Jennie Garth. As for Lindsay, she went on to star in hit films 'Freaky Friday', and 'Mean Girls', proving just how successful the 2000s were for both ladies. Although they worked in the same industry, the two were never friends.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here’s How Much Lindsay Lohan Paid For ‘Mean Girls’</a></span></p><p>Lindsay and Amanda were oftentimes pitted against one another, considering they were ultimately each other's competition. While they weren't the best of friends, they definitely pretended to be at times. During their peaks, the duo were often photographed together at events and red carpets, however it was all for show! It appears as if the saying "keeping your friends close and enemies closer" played a significant role in the two's relationship, leaving them labeled as "frenemies".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By 2007, Lohan had ditched her good-girl image and began to hang out with the likes of Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, leaving her to go down what would soon become a very dark and twisted path. The same ordeal occurred with Amanda, however this didn't happen until 2010, following Bynes' appearance in 'Easy A', marking her last acting role. During Amanda's downward spiral, she was often asked about Lohan and compared to her. This obviously didn't sit well with Bynes,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> leaving her to call out Lindsay for being a "b****"</a>, says Huff Post.</p><p>This seemed to have been the overall consensus when it came to the two's "friendship", leaving many close to both Lohan and Bynes to describe <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their relationship as having "chaotic energy"</a>.&nbsp;Although the two were never the best of friends, their connection to the industry and both being the "it" girls of the 2000s left them with no choice but to run in the same social circles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, a lot has changed between the two! Amanda is currently engaged to long-time boyfriend, Michael Paul, after undergoing a few stints in rehab. The former actress is also under a conservatorship led by her parents, which they believe is the best thing for Amanda.</p><p>As for Lindsay Lohan, the star has returned to acting both in film and television. The star opened up her very own beach club in Mykonos, Greece, which was documented on her hit reality show, 'Lindsay Lohan's Beach Club' on MTV. Lohan also had a lot of success with her show on OWN, in which she worked closely with the incomparable, Oprah Winfrey. She is also embarking on a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">brand new jewelry collaboration </a>which she has been promoting on Instagram for quite some time now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite their tumultuous breakdowns, led by the continued pressure child stars face in Hollywood, fans of both Lindsay and Amanda are glad to see both ladies in healthy and happy places in their lives. Although they were constantly "feuding" during the heights of their careers, it has become clear that Amanda and Lindsay paved the way for countless young stars, leaving many hopeful that while the may not be friendly now, that one day the two will join one another and rule the world once again.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Amanda Bynes Seen For The First Time In Six Months As Fans Say She Seems 'Lost'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dlrqiusOaZJuxnprAbq3NnWSloZ6ZwKLFjKWmoZmeYsC1tculZJ%2BqmZq7pb%2BO</p></div><div id=links><a href=./arnie-anderson-conchata-ferrell-husband-age-and-wikipedia-biography-children-photo-where-is-he-now.html>&#171;&nbsp;Arnie Anderson: Conchata Ferrell Husband, Age, And Wikipedia Biography, Children, Photo, Where is He</a>
