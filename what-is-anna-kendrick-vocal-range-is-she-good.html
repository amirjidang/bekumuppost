It was this role, as well as her role as Cinderella in Into The Woods that caught the attention of many for not just her acting skills, but also for her incredible singing voice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many actors are known for having many skills, including acting, singing, and dancing, just to name a few. However, whilst we may believe that they are equally good at all of these things, the actors themselves may disagree. Kendrick is no different, as she has recently stated that she believes that she is much better at acting than singing.</p><h2 id=what-is-anna-kendrick-39-s-vocal-range>What Is Anna Kendrick's Vocal Range?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/anna-kendrick-red-carpet.png><p>It is well known within the entertainment industry that if you want to get a job that involves singing, you have to have an amazing voice and this involves having a wide vocal range.</p><p>Especially when starring in a film that is based around singing acapella, Kendrick needed to have a good enough voice to not just win over the producers in order to get the role, but to also win over those going to see the movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Especially as she had to sing one of Pitch Perfect's most popular songs 'Cups (When I'm Gone)' solo, in order to have such an impact that the song can be downloaded millions of times, surely having a good vocal range is necessary here?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Anna Kendrick Refused To Wear Edgier Clothing For Pitch Perfect, Here's What She Said</a></span></p><p>From what is known, Kendrick is said to be a soprano and her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vocal range</a> is E3-G5. This means that her voice is able to go up two octaves, which is a relatively good amount to go up by, and also means that there is less strain on her voice.</p><p>Having said that, despite the fact that most singers tend to have a vocal range of two or three octaves, it is not uncommon for professional singers to have a <a href=#>vocal range of four or more octaves</a>. This includes singers such as Ariana Grande, Prince, Freddie Mercury, and Mariah Carey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-anna-kendrick-prefer-acting-or-singing>Does Anna Kendrick Prefer Acting Or Singing?</h2><p>As previously mentioned, Kendrick is known for her singing and acting capabilities, making her a double threat. This is true of many actors, including those who are also considered a triple threat for having both of these skills, plus being able to dance.</p><p>Kendrick is often compared to other actresses like Kristen Bell, who also sings (Frozen's Anna, anyone?), and it's even suggested that <a href=#>competition between the two dampened any possible friendship</a>.</p><p>Either way, Kendrick's skillset has led many fans to debate whether they feel she is better at singing than acting, whether she is better at acting than singing, or whether she is just as good at the two.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Anna Kendrick & Other Actors Who Started On Broadway</a></span></p><p>In an interview with Billboard Magazine, Kendrick stated that she actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">started out in music before going into acting</a>, stating that as a child she loved to sing along with stars such as Janet Jackson and Bette Midler, and would try and get her friends to join in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite starting out singing, Kendrick then went on to say that she actually believes she's better at acting than singing. She referred to herself as "very competent for an actor who sings, but I really don't know what I'm doing." But those who have seen any of her musical films will more than likely see her as competent in both singing and acting.</p><p>Regardless of Kendrick feeling that her acting is much better than her singing, she is at least able to recognize that there are some roles that she would never have gotten if it wasn't for her ability to sing. In the same interview, Kendrick stated that roles such as her role as Cinderella in Into The Woods she would never have gotten if it wasn't for her ability to sing and act.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Having the ability to do both of these skills and be recognized for it helps with where her career started. She started out on Broadway and at 12 years old starred in A Little Night Music. She also had a supporting role in High Society, and it was this role that got her nominated for a Tony award and caused her to become one of the <a href=#>youngest Tony nominees in history</a>.</p><h2 id=does-anna-kendrick-really-sing-in-pitch-perfect>Does Anna Kendrick Really Sing In Pitch Perfect?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/anna-kendrick.jpg><p>With a movie such as Pitch Perfect requiring the cast to sing acapella, this makes very little room for mistakes to be made, leading many fans of the film to question whether any of the cast, including Kendrick, actually sing in the film, or whether they are simply lip-syncing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What is known about Kendrick, in particular, is that in any scene in all three films where she is singing, she is very much singing live and is not lip-syncing to a pre-recorded track. Where most actors would choose to lip-sync, or the producers might decide that for them, this shows how strong a talent Kendrick is.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Close Are Brittany Snow And Anna Kendrick?</a></span></p><p>So when fans next decide to watch this movie, they can watch it with the knowledge that Kendrick and the rest of the cast are singing live. After all, it doesn't make sense for one actor to be singing live and for the rest to be lip-syncing, particularly when they're meant to be singing acapella.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecCnpZplm5q7pb7InKJmrp%2BYrq150ZqloJ1dnsBuv8eeZKCnn5l8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ash-williams-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-73080-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ash Williams Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a>
