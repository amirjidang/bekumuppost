rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Sandler's right-hand man</a>, Rob Schneider, is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one-hit-wonder</a> Elle King's dad.</p><p>You can see it in their eyes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Schneider had King with model London King in 1989, the year after&nbsp;he graduated from writer to full-time cast member on SNL. They weren't close during her childhood, but they didn't exactly have a feud, like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Schneider's feud with David Spade</a>, either.</p><p>In 2011, Schneider started another family when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he married Patricia Azarcoya</a>, and soon after, they had their two children, Miranda and Madeline. But King was struggling with her own life, as her father was re-starting his own. Now they're on better terms, but it took a while for them to reestablish their relationship.</p><p>Here's how they got reacquainted with one another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=things-went-down-hill-after-her-divorce>Things Went Down Hill After Her Divorce</h2><p>When King first broke out into the scene, the media quickly noticed that she was&nbsp;Schneider's daughter, and their first question was: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">why wasn't she using the Schneider name?</a></p><p>"I wanted to be myself," she&nbsp;explained to ABC News. "I am my own person."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Little-Known Facts About Rob Schneider's Wife And Kids</a></span></p><p>"It’s not that I wanted to be a famous person. I wanted to be a performer," she said. "But I worked really hard and I did everything myself and I took a name that ... is my mother’s name ... I took that name because I wanted to be myself."</p><p>"And, yeah, people know who my dad is," she added. "But I think that my voice and my music speaks for itself: that I am my own person."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She soon found out how much her voice and music spoke for themselves because her first album, especially her hit "Ex's and Oh's," was an immediate success. But as she was finding her success, she got knocked down a couple of pegs simultaneously.</p><p>In 2016, King married Andrew Ferguson in a secret ceremony that not even her parents knew about. No one found out about the marriage until they divorced a year later after King filed a domestic abuse lawsuit against Ferguson, which&nbsp;was later dropped.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Spade And Rob Schneider Host Unique Drive-In Comedy Show</a></span></p><p>King announced the marriage and the split on her Instagram. In her post, she explained that she'd been in a rough place before they got married, which was just three weeks after they'd met at a bar. She also explained that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she turned to substance abuse to handle her PTSD following the domestic abuse.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was partying so hard to numb emotions that I couldn't handle at the time. I realized it was just prolonging the inevitable of dealing with them. And what you have to do, unfortunately, is just feel them and that sucks," she told People. "I thought that by doing drugs it would buy me time to feeling better. And when that wasn't working, I just realized I was in this other cycle and that I was creating it myself. And I realized I needed to cut all the darkness out of my life."</p><p>She later got help and&nbsp;said it saved her life. "I think that reaching out [for help] saved my life. I don't wanna think of any other outcome that could have happened," she said. "I feel like the more I talk about it, maybe it could reach somebody — reach somebody that feels alone."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Chevy Chase Still Banned From 'SNL'?</a></span></p><p>Getting help also opened the door to a relationship with her dad again.&nbsp;After all she went through, "now the relationship I have with my father is what I always wanted," she continued.</p><p>"My whole childhood, my dad was a workaholic," she explained their relationship when she was a kid. Despite not seeing her father much when she was a child, having grown up in Ohio with her mom and her step-father Justin Tesa, King did have a small part in her father's film Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo in 1999.</p><h2 id=their-relationship-s-never-been-better>Their Relationship's Never Been Better</h2><p>King revealed one of the reasons she wanted to reconnect with her father&nbsp;was her two half-sisters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We both have grown up a lot. And you realize what’s important," she said. "Him having children — I wanted my sisters to have good memories of me from their childhood when they grew. Family really is so important. So through that, me just kind of showing up and trying to be good for them, really made it easy because there were no bad motives. When it’s about the kids, the bulls— kind of goes away. I love him."</p><p>Now their relationship couldn't be any better. She said he's her No. 1 fan, and, at the time, he couldn't wait for her second album, Shake the Spirit.</p><p>"Honestly, he’s probably my biggest supporter," King gushed. "Like, every other day I’ll get texts in all caps of like, 'Your record’s gonna change the world! I can’t wait for your fans to hear what you’ve made! I love you! I’m so proud of you!' And that’s a beautiful, wonderful thing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, being in the spotlight for some time now, King understands why her father was a "workaholic," and she respects that about him.</p><p>"This business is hard. It’s hard to find any balance in it. My dad just put everything into him — his success and trying to be successful," she said. "And I’m a lot like that. So my work, work has always come first. But my family life is where I want it to be."</p><p>King and Schneider will probably only get closer, now that the comedian is about to become a grandfather. You heard us right. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">King and her fiancé Dan Tooker are pregnant with&nbsp;their first child</a>. So King's family is certainly growing. Do you think Schneider will put on coconut boobs and his mop wig from 50 Firsts Dates to mess around with his grandchild? We hope so.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Little-Known Facts About Adam Sandler's Family</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6s7vBZqqcoJ6atqWx0axkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXay2tbSMoaCsZZSWwqi0056pZp2cobJut8innmg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-views-ana-navarro-gives-alyssa-farah-griffin-shady-elephant-gift.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Views Ana Navarro Gives Alyssa Farah Griffin Shady Elephant Gift</a>
