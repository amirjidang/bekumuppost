The notorious military subunit gets known for its vigorous training schedules, pushing the best men on the field. So he had to run three miles for their fitness test.</p><p>It was then he came across running. What started as a necessity became a hobby as it grew as a part of his daily routine. The initial pain and muscle aches were crucial to overcoming, but he began craving it.</p><p>Later he had a commanding officer who would take them for jogs anywhere from five to ten miles. The training may seem useless, but it would come in handy as soldiers can never know what the terrain may ask of them.</p><p>Although he used to get the exercise done in the morning, he started making excuses after work began piling up. Time was useless when he and his partner moved to New York as he devoted himself to serving in a reserve unit while his nights fueled his passion for&nbsp;comedy.</p><p>He found the only available timeslot before the sun rose and invited his&nbsp;wife&nbsp;to accompany him to walk to Central Park. Music was his best friend, burning CDs from Rocky and AC/DC songs.</p><p>But he would never shy away when the country needed him, jumping into active service after 9/11. The surreal experience enabled him to partake in the&nbsp;New York City Marathon, which he completed in just a week of training.</p><p>In 2018, he got to pay homage to his roots when he played the commanding officer in 12 Strong. He still remembers the harrowing day he got called to report to ground zero as the city cred and burned around him. He was one of the team working twelve hours daily as they moved bodies out of the concrete piles.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rob-riggle-diet-and-workout-has-he-done-plastic-surgery></span>Rob Riggle Diet And Workout- Has He Done Plastic Surgery?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No matter how meticulous Rob Riggle is about his workouts, he has yet to admit to any plastic surgery and keep himself fit with a planned&nbsp;diet.</p><p>Although he has not been into the specifics of his breakfast, lunch, and dinner, he keeps it mundane and nutritious while indulging in his favorite meals and drinks.</p><p>He has admitted that he is unable to resist any pancakes coming his way, with flapjacks and crepes coming a close second.</p><p>While his friends and co-worker do not blick twice before filling their faces with fillers or tweaking up a few features, he has had the same look since the day he entered the industry, never understanding the need for&nbsp;plastic surgery. He certainly does not need to go under the knife as people have resonated with his next-door neighbor’s looks.</p><p>But he had his share of exotic foods when he ate bull testicles after guest starring in The Wild Man Bear Grylls show. But his spirits were up as he looked straight into the camera and said he was eating Rocky Mountain oysters.</p><p>The former military men had to cross over the Great Basin Desert, where food is a luxury.&nbsp;Indeed, healthy supplements were hard to come by as they had to improvise with what they had.</p><p>The resident exotic eater Grylls himself was not too fond of eating the dedicates, calling them terrible once inside the mouth.&nbsp;But survival is a priority, understood by the Saturday Night Live alum, so he did not make a fuss.</p><p>Fortunately, he had deliciously dirty, mossy river water, filtered by his sock and underwear, to wash down the gonads.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rob-riggle-age-%e2%80%93-who-are-his-parents></span>Rob Riggle Age – Who Are His Parents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>52-year-old retired United States Marine officer Robert A. Riggle Jr is the son of American&nbsp;parents&nbsp;Sandra and her husband, Robert Allen Riggle.</p><p>He grew up in the south, under the shelter of an insurance worker dad in Louisville, Kentucky. Meanwhile, his mom operated as a school teacher and taught English.</p><p>By two years old, they had moved to Kansas as his extended family was living there, and he studied at Shawnee Mission South High School. He and his sister did not have to worry as they spent their summers in the lake house at the Ozarks, owned by their uncle.</p><p>Amazingly he rejoiced in the early years in the company of his cousins as they used to put together sketch shows and silly acts for the adults as threw quarters as their appreciation. Saving for his dreams was a faraway thought as the kids splurged their hard-earned dollars into karts, waterslides, and miniature golf.</p><p>Indeed, his funny side developed as he partook in the&nbsp;school’s&nbsp;radio and TV stations. Getting honored as the class clown, his path in comedy got set. But his dominance in sports was just as strong as he played football, baseball, and golf.</p><p>Later, he enrolled in the University of Kansas to get his pilot’s license while getting a B.A. in Theater and Film. He got incorporated into the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.</p><p>After getting his license, he resolved to serve his country and joined the United States Marine Corps Reserve. But the decision did not occur overnight, as his granddad was in the Eighth Army Air Corps during&nbsp;World War Two. He also promised to teach him how to fly if he wished to. The service makes him fly to various war-torn areas, including Albania, Afghanistan, Kosovo, and Liberia.</p><p>But his comedy career held a higher position in his heart as he did not think twice when his audiences began growing bigger. The nine years of active duty and 14 years in the reserves have earned him more than 22 medals and ribbons, as he even was one of the first responders to the 9/11 tragedy.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-was-rob-riggle-wife-tiffany-riggle></span>Who Was Rob Riggle Wife Tiffany Riggle?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Daily Show correspondent Rob Riggle was married to his wife Tiffany Riggle between 1999 to 2000.

He also claimed that he had stolen money.</p><p>TMZ argued that the actor had comprised to staying at a smaller home as the legal works took place to give space to his former lover and kids. During that period, a stash of almost thirty thousand dollars went missing from his office.</p><p>The allegations say that he got suspicious of her actions when she began to confront him about his private conversations, leading him to think she hacked his apple account.</p><p>Although she initially denied the accusations, she got caught when he plated false informants and took the bait. Confirming their suspicions, they turned the house upside down, searching for evidence.</p><p>Eventually, they found a camera hidden in one of his smoke detectors with a memory card of over 10,000 videos stored.</p><p>After the fiasco with his former&nbsp;spouse, he found love again after he dated 35-year-old professional golfer Kasia Kay.</p><p>The age gap of two decades is not a problem in the matter of love, as they made thing Instagram official in June.

The program got featured in the nearest festivals as he got just in Comedy Central commentary programs.</p><p>Around 2004, he got accepted to the stage of Saturday Night Live and got an official declaration as a castmate on the 30th-season premiere. With many impersonations under his belt, his most remembered character was Leviticus, a loud, violent street preacher.</p><p>By 2006, he had caught the eyes of The Daily Show, as he replaced the resident comedian, Rob Corddry, as the correspondent. Under the guidance of Jon Steward, he taped every sketch with originality and created the running gag of Jon being afraid of his co-worker.</p><p>Meanwhile, his standup comedy was ongoing in the background, as he frequented the comedy clubs in New York City and toured colleges.</p><p>Other filmmakers wanted to work with him as he got cast in The Office, a supporting role in Step Brothers, The Hangover, and The Other Guys, to name a few.
