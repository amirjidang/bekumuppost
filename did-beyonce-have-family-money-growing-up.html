I went to private school; we had a very nice house, cars, a housekeeper. I wasn’t doing this because I didn’t have a choice, or to support the family, or because I had to get out of a bad situation. I just was determined; this is what I wanted to do so bad”</p><p>Beyoncé's father, Mathew Knowles, had a job as a Xerox sales executive, where he achieved great success. He was able to use this success to provide a comfortable life for his children. Her mother, Celestine “Tina” Knowles, was a hairdresser who owned her own salon.
