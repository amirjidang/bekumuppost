11 of RHOBH</a> is underway, fans of&nbsp;the <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Housewives</a>&nbsp;</strong>are talking all about her divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From questions about&nbsp;whether Erika and Tom are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">getting divorced because of&nbsp;their age gap</a>&nbsp;to the news that comes out almost every day about their legal battle, there is so much to talk about.</p><p>Even though Erika has shown herself to be incredibly vulnerable in&nbsp;the latest episodes&nbsp;of&nbsp;RHOBH, some fans say that her divorce isn't real at all. Let's take a look at why some people think that it's fake.</p><h2 id=inside-the-divorce>Inside The Divorce</h2><p>Season 11 of the&nbsp;Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&nbsp;has&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained Erika and Tom's divorce</a>, as fans learned that Erika knew it was time to say goodbye to her marriage and moved out of the huge mansion that they shared.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans have called the divorce a "sham"</a>&nbsp;and according to&nbsp;People, Erika talks about that on the reality show, explaining, "What's being said is just, I mean, it's insane. That lawsuit that says that my divorce is a sham so I could hide assets. People want to believe that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It turns out that people think that the divorce is fake because of the lawsuit that Erika mentioned. According to&nbsp;People, families of victims of a plane crash sued the couple through Edelson PC, a law firm, saying that they embezzled settlement money.</p><p>The lawsuit said, "At the heart of this deception is Defendant Girardi and his need to fund outrageous lifestyles for himself and his soon-to-be ex-wife, Erika Jayne," according to&nbsp;People. It continued, "While Erika publicly filed for divorce this month, on information and belief, that ‘divorce’ is simply a sham attempt to fraudulently protect Tom’s and Erika’s money from those that seek to collect on debts owed by Tom and his law firm GK."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans do think that there is a connection between the lawsuit and divorce: a fan suggested on Reddit, "She’s trying to cover for him and agreed to divorce to probably hide assets." Another said, "The kindest read I can think of is that maybe Erika found out about the embezzlement and that made her feel some way about her marriage? I for sure think the divorce and the lawsuit are linked."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Think These Are The Most Controversial Real Housewives</a></span></p><h2 id=what-is-the-truth>What Is The Truth?</h2><p>Of course, there is no way to know what the truth is here, as unless someone talks to Erika and Tom directly, there is only the news stories that are out there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But one thing is for sure, Erika seems distressed and upset by these allegations.</p><p>It also sounds like Erika might not know anything about the allegations around embezzling money: according to&nbsp;People, she says in the midseason trailer for&nbsp;RHOBH, ""If he stole the money, I'd like to know where it is."</p><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Erika asked for spousal support</a>, Tom didn't want that, according to&nbsp;Us Weekly.</p><p>A source explained that Erika was in the dark about what was going on: they said, "Erika was completely unaware of the very serious allegations that were being made against Tom in court.&nbsp;Tom always handled all of the finances and that was how they handled things. Erika feels betrayed by Tom because she completely trusted him. She is just reeling from all of this, but make no mistake. Erika is a tough cookie and she isn’t stupid. She will get through this," according&nbsp;to&nbsp;Us Weekly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The publication also reported that Tom said his financial situation is actually pretty dire: "At one point I had about $80 million or $50 million in cash. That’s all gone. I don’t have any money.”</p><p>It has been so shocking to see Tom and Erika get divorced because, as many viewers would agree, they did seem to be doing well, and Erika kept saying that the marriage worked really well for them. But as viewers recently learned, that wasn't the case and Erika didn't feel happy or good about it for a long time.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The ‘RHOBH’ Moment Fans Think Went Too Far</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It has been interesting watching Erika and the other housewives have discussions about her divorce on&nbsp;RHOBH. According to&nbsp;Page Six, she told them that they should be aware of how much money is in their bank accounts instead of just assuming that everything is fine because their partners take care of it.</p><p>Erika told them, “I’m gonna give you a lesson that I’ve learned. You see what’s happening to me today. Please, look at your bank accounts. You have to. Don’t ignore it. The more money your husband makes, the more they shut you out. And then 22 years later, it doesn’t end up great.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All The Men & Women Brandi Glanville From ‘RHOBH’ Has Been Linked To</a></span></p><p>Fans will have to keep watching this season of&nbsp;RHOBH&nbsp;to see what else comes up.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Think This Was The Most Embarrassing Moment In ‘Real Housewives’ History</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmnZqmo2Kus7GMnJilpJmjtG6x0aKimmWXnr%2BivsOiqmacmau8s6%2FEZp2ao5Vk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-close-are-quentin-tarantino-and-christopher-nolan.html>&#171;&nbsp;How Close Are Quentin Tarantino And Christopher Nolan?</a>
