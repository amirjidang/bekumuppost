The former couple got married in September 1997 and share three children: Rafferty (<a href=#>who was linked to Rita Ora</a> back in 2020), Iris, and Rudy. The kids ranged from age two to eight when the nanny was hired, and Jude and Sadie had more than one nanny to manage them all between their two houses.</p><p>Daily Mail reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jude and his ex Sadie Frost hired the nanny, Daisy Wright, in 2004.</a> In the same year they hired Daisy, Jude got engaged to actress Sienna Miller.

And despite this painful memory from their past, all parties involved have moved on. Since this article was published in 2020, Jude Law, who has five children from three previous relationships, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has welcomed his sixth child with his wife Philipa Coan in September 2020.</a> He's also been busy with his acting career, playing the part of Dumbledore in the Fantastic Beasts franchise.</p><p>As for Sienna, she is currently single after splitting from her fiancé Lucas Zwirner back in 2020. She is still regarded as a fashion icon, but hasn't really been acting since 2020, or active on social media since late 2021. She has spoken about the affair since, however, revealing in an interview she did with The Daily Beast in December 2020 that there are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">six whole weeks of the experience she doesn't remember</a> from the traumatic experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on April 21, 2022: </strong>While Jude Law's cheating scandal rocked Hollywood back in 2005, and while everyone involved was quite shaken up about it at the time, it does seem as if all parties have moved on successfully. Sienna Miller is playing the main role on the new Netflix series Anatomy of a Scandal, while Jude Law continues to star as the beloved Albus Dumbledore in the Wizarding World films. Daisy Wright continues to maintain her privacy, but she seems to be living a happy and successful life out of the spotlight.</p><p>In an interview to promote Anatomy of a Scandal, Sienna Miller spoke about this particular scandal that she was a part of.
