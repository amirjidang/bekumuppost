Dark Knight</a>, arguably the most successful DC film to date (even if <a href=#>it might have been "cursed"</a>). The film may be most remembered for Christian Bale’s performance as Batman and the late Heath Ledger’s take on Joker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But one can’t deny that Eckhart’s portrayal of Harvey Dent and later on, <a href=#>the menacing Two-Face</a>, was a master class in onscreen transformation.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Christian Bale's Photographic Memory Helped Him While Playing Batman</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, fans didn’t get to see more of Harvey (or Two-Face) in Nolan’s third Batman film, The Dark Knight Rises.</p><p>Since then, Eckhart has moved on from DC too. After all, this is a veteran actor who has been booking film roles long before he stepped into Batman’s world. In fact, he even went on to join another major Hollywood film franchise.</p><h2 id=aaron-eckhart-starred-in-this-rom-com-with-a-lsquo-friends-rsquo-star>Aaron Eckhart Starred In This Rom-Com With A ‘Friends’ Star</h2><p>After leaving Gotham, Eckhart to star opposite Jennifer Aniston in the romantic comedy Love Happens. In the film, Eckhart plays a widower and best-selling self-help author who falls for a florist played by the Friends star. And for Aniston, it wasn’t really hard to fall for her co-star onscreen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“He's really gorgeous, he really is and so funny, wickedly funny and he's very interesting,” the actress told CheshireLive. “He's deep, Aaron's deep - he's a thinker - so we just had a ball together. We laughed, I love his sense of humor, I love him talking about philosophy and psychology, he's great.”</p><p>Aniston also couldn’t help but gush over Eckhart’s dedication and professionalism while making the movie.</p><p>“Aaron is spot on and moves you so much,” the actress gushed. “I found him extremely dedicated and focussed. When you work with a performer like that, you constantly have someone giving you something good to volley with.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aaron-eckhart-followed-this-up-with-a-drama-with-nicole-kidman>Aaron Eckhart Followed This Up With A Drama With Nicole Kidman</h2><p>After wrapping up on his rom-com, Eckhart went on to star in the drama Rabbit Hole with Kidman.

It's very sensitive to go in there, of course it is. I did the research,” Eckhart revealed while speaking on The Howard Stern Show. And even if he was just there for research, the actor did start to feel like he was grieving.</p><p>“100 percent, I lost it. You really believe that you just lost a child. You are as close to reality in that sense as possible.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Kidman, the actress came to admire how dedicated Eckhart was to the film. “Aaron brought everything to this,” the Oscar winner told Emanuel Levy. “I loved watching his process, the way he explores all the avenues. He’s so open as an actor, and he’s a dream to be around.”</p><h2 id=later-on-aaron-eckhart-also-played-potus-in-this-gerard-butler-led-franchise>Later On, Aaron Eckhart Also Played POTUS In This Gerard-Butler Led Franchise</h2><p>Several years later, Eckhart was tapped to join Butler in the Has Fallen franchise where played U.S. President Benjamin Asher.

And being the kind of actor that he is, Eckhart fully committed to his role once again.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Becoming Catwoman Was 'Different' For Zoë Kravitz</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“As an actor, you want to feel that you’re actually in the circumstances that they put you in. So I had to be up in those cuffs for eight hours a day, or more. I didn’t take them down too often; I didn’t like to take them off,” the actor confessed during an interview with Shock Ya!.</p><p>“Pretty soon into the movie, I think I lost feeling in both of my arms. I would go home, and my arms would be numb. I actually had to question the doctor about it.”</p><h2 id=aaron-eckhart-also-starred-in-this-oscar-nominated-film>Aaron Eckhart Also Starred In This Oscar-Nominated Film</h2><p>After wrapping up work on two Has Fallen movies (he didn't join the third installment, Angel Has Fallen), Eckhart went on to star alongside Tom Hanks in the Oscar-nominated biopic Sully.

I want people to come up to Jeff and go, ‘hey, that was an awesome movie’.”</p><p>Aside from these films, Eckhart also starred in titles such as I, Frankenstein, The Rum Diary, Battle Los Angeles, Midway, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the sports biopic Bleed for This with Miles Teller</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, fans can expect to see Eckhart in the upcoming Showtime series The First Lady where <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he will play President Gerald Ford</a>.
