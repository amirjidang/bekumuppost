Thanks to Turner accumulating that kind of money, she shouldn't have had any financial worries during the last several years of her life.</p><p>While it is wonderful for Turner that she made so much money, that can actually become a problem once the star is gone. After all, it seems like there are verbal fights and legal battles every time a star with a lot of money passes away these days.</p><p>When Turner passed away, she wasn't an exception as her daughter-in-law Afida Turner came forward to make an interesting claim.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tina Turner Left The US For A Private Escape Worth $76 Million Off The Map, But What Did Her Neighbors Think About Her?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For many years, it has been reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Turner had four sons</a>. Turner gave birth to two of her children, Ronnie Turner and Craig Raymond Turner. Then there were Turner's children she reportedly adopted during her marriage to Ike Turner, Michael Turner and Ike Turner Jr.</p><p>Tragically for Turner, two of her sons passed away before she did. In 2018, it was revealed that Turner's son Craig Raymond Turner had died at his own hand. To Turner's eternal credit, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she spoke about her grief publicly</a> in the aftermath which certainly gave other parents in a similar situation some small level of comfort.</p><p>Four years later in 2022, Turner's other son Ronnie Turner passed away after bravely battling colon cancer.

Afida Turner also later expressed her sorrow at having lost Ronnie Turner and Tina Turner in such quick succession.</p><p>Following Turner's passing, Afida Turner spoke to The Sunday Mirror about the famed singer's estate. Surprisingly, Afida Turner <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed that Tina Turner never actually legally adopted Ike Turner Jr.</a> as has been long believed. Afida also made claims about the likely distribution of Tina Turner's estate.</p><p>“As she married in Switzerland, I think around 47 percent will go to the spouse and the rest to the children.” “Tina’s two children are Craig and Ronnie – she never adopted Ike Jr. It’s just because she was with Ike that they were in the family, so the only ‘blood’ descendants are Craig and Ronnie. Today I’m the only one with the name – there are no other Turners.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Did Tina Turner Spend Her Enormous Net Worth Before Her Tragic Death?

Instead, Afida Turner said that she was interested in respecting Tina Turner's final wishes. “I’ve always earned my own money – no one has ever given me anything in the Turner family – that’s the Turner way, OK.”</p><p>According to reports, it was widely believed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Turner's husband Erwin Bach would receive a large chunk of her estate. </a>While the exact percentage Bach received can't be confirmed, it is clear that he received one of her biggest assets.</p><p>Within days of Turner passing away, The Toronto Sun reported that Bach had big plans for one of her most valuable assets. According to their report, Bach decided to transition Turner's Swiss estate which is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">valued at $76 million into a museum dedicated to the singer</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tina-turner-and-erwin-bach-before-her-pasing.jpg><p>For Bach to be the one to decide what to do with Turner's estate, it seems extremely likely that he received a large chunk of her estate. Between that and Afida Turner's statement that he would receive almost half of Turner's estate, it seems all but certain that Bach was left more of Turner's estate than anyone else.</p><p>Given that Turner had two surviving children and the widow of one of her kids was still alive, some people may question likely leaving so much to Bach. However, that makes a lot more sense once people learn the history of Turner and Bach's relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-was-tina-turner-39-s-husband-erwin-bach>Who Was Tina Turner's Husband, Erwin Bach?</h2><p>If most people were asked to name Tina Turner's husband, they would name Ike Turner.

Bach worked for EMI, eventually becoming an executive for the company that distributed Turner's music in Europe. According to Turner, it was love at first sight after she met Bach who was sent by EMI to pick her up from the airport. Turner even said her heart started to beat faster immediately after meeting Bach.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/did-tina-turner-leave-her-much-younger-husband-erwin-bach-a-fortune-after-she-died_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, lots of couples who initially think it is love at first sight quickly burn out. On top of that, many people were betting against Turner and Bach since he was sixteen years younger than her which the couple says they were judged for.</p><p>Sadly for Turner and Bach, some people assumed that he got involved with her for her money. Considering how successful Bach was in his career, that seems silly. On top of that, Bach and Turner became a couple in 1986, and they didn't get married until decades later in 2013. In the intervening years, Bach asked Turner to marry him multiple times, and she was the one who wasn't sure, and he respected that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tina-turner-and-erwin-bach-looking-happy-together.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nothing about that timeline makes it seem like Bach was after Turner's money. Still, the perception that Bach was after Turner's money was so pervasive that she wrote about the rumors in her memoir "My Love Story".</p><p>"Incredibly, considering how long we had been together, there were still people who wanted to believe that Erwin married me for my money and fame. What else would a younger man want with an older woman? Erwin always ignored the rumors,"</p><p>If nothing else convinced observers that Bach and Turner truly loved one another, what happened in 2017 should have. After Turner struggled with illnesses for years, she went into kidney failure. As Turner revealed in her memoir, Bach was her rock throughout her medical issues, and he donated a kidney to save her life without a second thought.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqbavrYytrKumlad6rbHAr5xmsZ%2Bqu6ix0WafrquSlrulecSrrqKmXZeupLSMmmSfp6Kpwq%2BxjJqdrZ2iYsCpsYydoJ6cXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./dylan-riley-snyders-age-height-girlfriend-net-worth-gay-2-507283-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Dylan Riley Snyders Age, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth.
