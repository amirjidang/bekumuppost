Here's everything you need to know about the new single.</p><h2 id=who-is-hunter-hayes><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Who Is Hunter Hayes?</span></h2><p>Hunter Hayes is a 31-year-old multi-genre singer and songwriter from Louisiana, though his early music typically leans toward country. He's proficient in more than 30 instruments, and in 2014 he <a href=#>broke a Guinness World Record</a> for most concerts performed in multiple cities in 24 hours. Hunter was also named the leader of Country Music's Youth Revolution by Billboard that same year. He's been nominated for five Grammy Awards, and he won the CMA award for New Artist of the Year in 2012 as well as three BMI Awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="10 Musicians Who Changed Genres In The Middle Of Their Career">10 Musicians Who Changed Genres In The Middle Of Their Career</a></span></p><h2 id=how-did-hunter-39-s-career-start><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>How Did Hunter's Career Start?</span></h2><p>Hunter has been performing since his grandmother gifted him an accordion when he was just 2 years old, so his love for music has existed for as far back as he can remember. At age 4, he began making appearances locally and on national television, such as on the Nickelodeon game show Figure It Out. At age 7, he was invited to perform at the White House for then-President Bill Clinton. At 9, he released his debut studio album Through My Eyes, and he appeared on America's Most Talented Kids when he was 13</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His fame only continued to grow from there as he was featured as the opening act on Taylor Swift's Speak Now World Tour in 2011. His own headlining tour began later that year after the release of his eponymous album, "Hunter Hayes."</p><h2 id=where-else-have-we-seen-hunter><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Where Else Have We Seen Hunter?</span></h2><p>In addition to going on tour, Hunter has also <a href=#>competed on The Masked Singer</a>, where he rocked an astronaut mask, as well as made appearances on Hollywood Game Night, The Bachelor, and The Celebrity Apprentice. In 2016, Hunter appeared in the comedy series Bella and The Bulldogs as well.</p><p>Hunter has also been outspoken about his own struggles with mental health, and he <a href=#>became a spokesperson for Mental Health Awareness Month in collaboration with One Mind</a>, a mental health advocacy organization, in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-success-has-hunter-experienced-in-his-career><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>What Success Has Hunter Experienced In His Career?</span></h2><p>As mentioned previously, Hunter has won numerous awards since he began his career. In 2012, he became the youngest member to be inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame, and that same year he became the youngest solo male act to top the Hot Country Songs with the lead single off his first album, Wanted. He was also named the CMA’s New Artist of the Year that same year.</p><p>In 2013, Hunter was one of five country music stars to be named CMT's 2013 Artists of the Year, alongside Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line, and Tim McGraw. In 2014, he released his second album, Storyline, which featured the single, Invisible, and he released his third album, The 21 Project, composed of three EPs in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Katy Perry Pranks Luke Bryan on 'American Idol'">Katy Perry Pranks Luke Bryan on 'American Idol'</a></span></p><h2 id=has-hunter-faced-any-hardship-in-his-career><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Has Hunter Faced Any Hardship In His Career?</span></h2><p>After the release of his 3rd album, The 21 Project, and his single Rescue, Hunter started to go through a rough patch, both personally and professionally. He was dealing with a breakup as well as troubles with friends and a trusted business associate. In the end, Hunter turned to music. In 2019, he released an album called "Wild Blue," which details some of the hardships that he faced over the past few years. One of the most vulnerable songs is called "Dear God," where Hunter wrestles with questions about his faith and his own worthiness.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>About the album, he said, </a>“I hope that this is a new bar in transparency for me. I hope this album is the starting point from here forward. I also hope that internally for me this proves I can be. I feel like ‘Dear God’ showed that to me. I was painfully honest with the world, and the response was awesome.”</p><h2 id=what-has-he-produced-so-far><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>What Has He Produced So Far?</span></h2><p>In total, Hunter has 9 studio albums, 1 compilation album, and 12 singles. Hunter's single, Wanted, from his eponymous album in 2011 sold over 3.5 million copies and made Hunter the youngest male act to ever top the Billboard Hot Country Songs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-music-usually-about><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>What Is Music Usually About?</span></h2><p>Hunter tends to get very personal with his music. While a lot of songs talk about relationships and love, some others stem from dealing with bullying in the past, like "Invisible," as well as his own self-doubts, like "Dear God." Since the debut of "Invisible," Hunter has been very outspoken about his own struggles with mental health and has taken part in partnerships to raise money for organizations like To Write Love On Her Arms.</p><p>Hunter <a href=#>hopes that his music can help others navigate their own struggles, saying</a> “Invisible’ was really the first time I let the world into that side of my life and my heart — things that previously I thought I wasn’t allowed to write about. I’ll never forget the response. I just wanted one person to hear 'Invisible,' and for it to matter to them and change their perspective.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="8 Celebrities Who Prioritized Their Mental Health Over Their Careers ">8 Celebrities Who Prioritized Their Mental Health Over Their Careers</a></span></p><h2 id=what-is-his-new-single-about><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>What Is His New Single About?</span></h2><p>This week, Hunter just released a new single called "Friend." According to Hunter, "At its core, this song is about how sometimes the hardest part of a relationship not working out is losing that person you connected with in the beginning, that companion you wish you could keep, that friend you can't imagine your life without."</p><p>The lyrics discuss this idea of not wanting to lose someone that you were in a relationship with, so much that you just hope to be friends. The song seems to stray away from country and take on more pop and R&B/soul tones. The song is <a href=#>available for download</a> and its accompanying music video is also out now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-can-we-expect-from-hunter-next><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What Can We Expect From Hunter Next?</span></h2><p>I think it's safe to say that there is still much more to come from Hunter. His next album, "Red Sky (Part II)," is set to be released in 2023. Hunter has said that the forthcoming album <a href=#>explores the more adventurous side of himself</a> as well as new genres of music, and some of the songs already released, such as "The One That Got Away," "Missing You," and now "Friend," reflect that. One thing is for sure — we are excited to be here for all of these new adventures that Hunter takes on!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYpaRdlq%2BwwdNmn66mpJq%2FbrTAspysZZ6axG6%2FyKeepZ1dm7%2Bqsc2dZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./model-y-tesla-yacht-current-info.html>&#171;&nbsp;All The Current Info On The $700 Million Model Y Tesla Yacht</a>
