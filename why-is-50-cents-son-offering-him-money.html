Although his career didn't pick up traction for quite some time, 50 Cent has been making music since the mid-1990s under the wing of none other than Jam Master Jay of Run DMC.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was around this time that he met Shaniqua Tompkins and the two had a son, Marquise Jackson. Jackson initially said that having a son changed his perspective on life, and <a href=#>made him want to do better so that he can provide for him</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href=#>the two's relationship soured</a>, as would the relationship with Shaniqua Tompkins, and the pair ultimately separated when Marquise was just 10 years old.</p><p>Their relationship has been strained for over a decade now, but Marquise Jackson isn't giving up on getting his famous father's attention and is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">offering to pay $6,700</a>, the monthly amount his mother received in child support, for 24 hours of his time.</p><h2 id=50-cent-has-had-a-rough-relationship-with-marquise-jackson-39-s-mother>50 Cent Has Had A Rough Relationship With Marquise Jackson's Mother</h2><p>In the mid-1990s, 50 Cent and Shaniqua Tompkins were living together when their son Marquise was born. At the time, 50 Cent was excited to have his first child, even getting his Marquise's name tattooed on his right bicep shortly after his birth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for Marquise, the relationship between his mother and celebrity father was a rocky one and ultimately came to an end in 2008. There are rumors that 50 Cent caught Tompkins living in their home with another man, but most sources confirm that the pair just weren't getting along.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="All The Evidence That Suggests Paris Hilton Dated 50 Cent">All The Evidence That Suggests Paris Hilton Dated 50 Cent</a></span></p><p>Things really came to a head when the pair began to argue about the Long Island mansion they shared, with Shaniqua alleging that 50 Cent promised the mansion to her. This eventually lead to an ugly and lengthy legal battle between the two.</p><p>The mansion suspiciously caught fire, with Tompkins accusing her now ex of the fire, but he was in another state filming a movie when the blaze took place. Not too long after this, Marquise and his mother moved away from 50 Cent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The move did little to quell the bad blood between the two, and their feud has been ongoing long after the two called it quits. Both Shaniqua and 50 Cent have been at each other's throats on social media, with the rapper going so far as to tell Shaniqua to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">get a job after she signed up for a reality show</a>.</p><p>50 Cent stated in a now-deleted tweet that he "owns [her] life rights" and that her doing a reality show is a "no go." Tompkins was quick to respond, affirming that her ex doesn't have the power over her he believes he does and that he cannot stop her from doing anything.</p><h2 id=the-feud-between-50-cent-and-his-son-has-been-ongoing>The Feud Between 50 Cent And His Son Has Been Ongoing</h2><p>The origins are the feud between Marquise are not super known, but some suspect he is just in it by proxy of his mother.

Sire was born to 50 Cent and Daphne Joy, who are now split up. 50 Cent has alleged that Joy is now in a relationship with P. Diddy, but she assured him on Instagram that this is not true.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It appears that the relationship between Joy and the rapper may be strained as well, but this does not stop 50 Cent from having a healthy and loving relationship with his youngest son.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="50 Cent Speaks Out About Rumors Of His Unpaid Medical Bills ‘Get Outta Here’">50 Cent Speaks Out About Rumors Of His Unpaid Medical Bills ‘Get Outta Here’</a></span></p><p>The two are often seen photographed together, with 50 Cent showing affection and even being silly in pictures with Sire. The rapper has supported his youngest son's career as well, including his acting and modeling endeavors.</p><p>Marquise Jackson is still young, and his willingness to want to have a relationship with his father may be enough for the pair to finally make amends and have as close a father-son relationship as 50 Cent and Sire do, with the added opportunity for Marquise to finally meet his younger brother.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnsBugY9mmp6mpKh6tLvNZqafnpWntq%2BzjKGgpmWdpLumxY4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./a-project-research-on-extraction-and-study-of-effect-of-heat-on-caffeine-extracted-from-kola-nut-2.html>&#171;&nbsp;A PROJECT RESEARCH ON EXTRACTION AND STUDY OF EFFECT OF HEAT ON CAFFEINE EXTRACTED FROM KOLA NUT</a>
