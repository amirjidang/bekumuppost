The actors grew up alongside the characters! Even with the last film being released almost 10 years ago, fans still can recall the last time they saw these beloved characters on the big screen. There are many friendships that have stayed strong after the films' conclusion, including the one between Hermione's Emma Watson and Draco's Tom Felton.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Emma's role in the&nbsp;Harry Potter&nbsp;franchise allowed her to accumulate<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;staggeringly huge net worth</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom has been dabbling in music</a> and continues to act in many projects. Every time photos of Emma and Tom hanging out are posted online, we are in awe of how close they are. However, they have not become a couple.</p><p>Regardless of what happens, these two are giving fans hope that the Harry Potter cast still hang out with each other.</p><p>Here is everything we know about&nbsp;Tom Felton and Emma Watson's relationship.</p><h2 id=learned-an-instrument-thanks-to-him><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Learned An Instrument Thanks To Him</span></h2><p>Tom might not have a music career as he hoped, but he did teach his friend to play an instrument. Just seeing Tom and Emma, all comfy in their pajamas and trying out the guitar, is sweet and wholesome.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything involving these two hanging out is enough to make Harry Potter fans nostalgic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=will-they-or-won-t-they><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Will They Or Won't They?</span></h2><p>Many fans love seeing costars from their favorite movies hang out together, even going so far as to question if there is some romance going on behind the scenes. Due to how close Emma and Tom are, rumors sparked about them being a possible couple.</p><p>According to Metro, Tom joined the dating app, Raya, months after rumors about him and Emma being in a romantic relationship arose. Right now, it is just up in the air, since the two value their friendship more than anything.</p><h2 id=the-many-instagram-photos><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The Many Instagram Photos</span></h2><p>It's no surprise how many photos there are of Tom or Emma with both of them tagged in captions. They know how to take photographs of each other - each one wants the other to look great in any setting. Emma's caption summed it up perfectly, "Friends capture you best."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">16 Surprising Ways Tom Felton Maintains His Reported $20 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=the-slap-was-too-real><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>The Slap Was Too Real</span></h2><p>The final scene of Hermione confronting Draco involved the Slytherin student getting punched. But originally, it was meant to be a slap. Being the good friends they are, they rehearsed the slapping scene.</p><p>Little did Tom know that the slap was not faked, but instead an actual slap. Not only was there full-on collision with Emma's hand on Tom's face, she felt really bad about it and apologized profusely.</p><h2 id=what-they-do-behind-the-scenes><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>What They Do Behind The Scenes</span></h2><p>Behind-the-scenes features are some of the coolest additions to movies. Being able to see actors goof around or prepare for their next scenes gives perspective on what it's like to make films.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom shared a video on his Instagram</a> of him and Emma doing a hand game, with Daniel Radcliffe tuning in for the laughs. This is the earliest footage of their friendship evolving and it is still crazy how many years ago this occurred.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=attended-her-big-film-premiere><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Attended Her Big Film Premiere</span></h2><p>If an actor has absolutely nothing to do with a film, seeing them at a movie premiere can be surprising. However, it was no surprise that Tom was there when Emma attended the premiere of the live-action&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast. He was&nbsp;giving support to his dear friend.</p><p>He also had a single red rose in his possession, and if that is not symbolic, in light of the role Emma had in the film, we don't know what is. Harry Potter costar, Matthew Lewis, also attended, so there was a mini-reunion during that night.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An Inside Look At The Transformation Of Draco Malfoy In âHarry Potterâ</a></span></p><h2 id=more-things-to-teach-her><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>More Things To Teach Her</span></h2><p>Not only did Tom teach Emma how to play guitar but he also took it upon himself to teach her how to use a skateboard. Tom commented that she turned out to be great at it, but Emma would say otherwise.</p><p>They recorded themselves skateboarding through the Venice Beach boardwalk and it was pretty magical seeing them have fun...and go full circle from how Emma fell for him in the first place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-cute-crush><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>A Cute Crush</span></h2><p>The dating rumors might turn out to be false, but shippers of Hermione and Draco were on cloud nine when Emma confessed that she used to have a crush on her costar. Having to admit something like that can be seen as embarrassing - it was a bold move for Emma.</p><p>Being young and in love is not surprising but Emma was around 10 years old. As for Tom, how did he react when it was revealed that she had a crush on him?</p><h2 id=and-he-found-it-flattering><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>And He Found It Flattering</span></h2><p>Tom was very pleased about the fact that Emma had a crush on him when they were young kids. He just had the biggest smile on his face and they now talk about it with laughter. He wasn't aware of the crush back then - he saw Emma as a younger sister at one point, before finding out.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emma Watson Declares Herself âSelf-Partneredâ</a></span></p><h2 id=costar-thought-something-was-going-on><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Costar Thought Something Was Going On</span></h2><p>Not only were superfans believing that there was something more happening between Emma and Tom, even Ron (Rupert Grint) thought that the two were an item!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He admitted that he saw sparks fly between his onscreen love interest and rival. Tom and Emma's bond goes to show that they can fool their fellow friend/costar.</p><h2 id=very-encouraging><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Very Encouraging</span></h2><p>To give credit where credit's due, Tom helped out when it came to boosting Emma's confidence. When she was young, fame was something she saw as stressful, and understandably so. In order to help her feel comfortable with her rising stardom, Tom suggested interacting with her fans. It would eventually do her good and we can thank the bad boy wizard for that.</p><h2 id=still-hanging-out-together><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Still Hanging Out Together</span></h2><p>There are some friendships that will last for a lifetime, and we can definitely see that for Emma and Tom. Despite the fact that it's almost 10 years since The Deathly Hallows Part 2 was released in theaters, the two costars manage to find time to reunite and have fun.</p><p>Whether it is supporting each other by going to the other's movie premieres, hanging out at public places, or getting casual at home, this Harry Potter friendship will be remembered by millions of fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Throwback Pics Of Emma Watson Are Too Good To Ignore</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKVdm7KtwM6nZJqmlGKyrrnAZq6arKOku7R50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZKydk6eytb%2BO</p></div><div id=links><a href=./heres-how-bill-hader-became-a-hollywood-star.html>&#171;&nbsp;Here's How Bill Hader Became A Hollywood Star</a>
