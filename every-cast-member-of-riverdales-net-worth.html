Whether the producers of&nbsp;Riverdale created the show based on the popularity of the comics or they did it to put a twist on a classic series, the show has been nothing short of amazing. Filled with drama, mystery, and some comedy, the&nbsp;series follows the murder of Jason Blossom and those who try to figure out the mystery that is his death. It includes all of the classic characters including Chery, Vennessa, Betty, Jug, and Archie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Riverdale: 20 Plot Holes We're Still Scratching Our Heads Over</a></span></p><h2 id=casey-cott---200-000><strong>Casey Cott - $200,000</strong></h2><p>It may be dangerous to do illegal things with the Sherrif's son, but Kevin Keller is no snitch. This sassy teen is gossipy but supportive, spiteful but caring. The man behind the character, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Casey Scott</a> is a 'new kid' in Hollywood, as are most of the young people on this list. He began theater in 2011, performing locally. Eventually, though he got his big break, earning himself a role in an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit in 2017 and then&nbsp;Instinct in 2018. He is also cast to play a role in an upcoming film called&nbsp;The Mastoc in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashleigh-murray---1-million><strong>Ashleigh Murray - $1 million</strong></h2><p>Another child of an authority figure; Josie, the lead singer of Josie and the Pussy Cats, is the daughter of Riverdale's mayor. She is sassy and kind of hard to love at first, but slowly her character grows and she becomes kind and maybe even a little vulnerable. The actress that portrayed her did such a great job that they plan on staring her in a&nbsp;Riverdale spinoff. That's right, Ashleigh Murray is going to be playing Josie McCoy in the&nbsp;spinoff they are calling&nbsp;Katey Keene. She can also be seen in&nbsp;Welcome to New York, Grind, and Debra and Laney Rob a Train.</p><h2 id=madelaine-petsch---1-million><strong>Madelaine Petsch - $1 million</strong></h2><p>Every show has to have a bad girl, right?&nbsp;Riverdale's version of that would definitely have to be Cheryl Blossom, the sister of Jason Blossom who was murdered moments after she helped him escape the dingey little down. Cheryl Blossom is troubled, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madelaine Petsch</a> does a fantastic job at portraying that. She hasn't been acting for long (since about 2014), but her skills are immeasurable. Petsch can be seen in movies like&nbsp;The Hive (2014),&nbsp;F the Prom (2017), and&nbsp;Polaroid (2019), as well as on her Youtube channel, "Madelaine Petsch".</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Net Worth Of The Cast And Crew Of Family Guy</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lili-reinhart---2-million><strong>Lili Reinhart - $2 million</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lili Reinhart</a>, an American actress, developed a love for singing, dancing, and acting at a very young age. She even left her home at the young age of 18 to pursue her dream of becoming an actress. Her career began in 2011 and her acting has only gotten better, as she begins to take on larger and larger roles. In the past, she has been in productions such as&nbsp;Lilith (2011), Not Waving But Drowning (2012), and The Good Neighbor (2016). At the young age of just 22 years old, she has made quite a name for herself and continues to make her presence more and more noticed in Hollywood.</p><h2 id=marisol-nichols---3-million><strong>Marisol Nichols - $3 million</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marisol Nichols</a> is a talented American actress who has quite an extensive filmography profile compared to some of the people on this list. She has been seen in&nbsp;Scream 2 (1997), The Princess and the Marine (2001), Felon (2008) and is also cast to play Angie Garza in&nbsp;The Organ Donar. In&nbsp;Riverdale, though, she plays the mother of&nbsp;Veronica Lodge: Hermione Lodge. She is so important in the story that she gets her own storyline as she faces the mess that her husband Hiram Lodge left for her before going to jail. Hermione is a strong-willed and head-strong character, who seems to always make it through.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=m-dchen-amick---3-million><strong>Mädchen Amick - $3 million</strong></h2><p>Alice Cooper can be seen as a cold woman and a very difficult character to love at first. After years of controlling both of her daughters and not letting them have a say in their own lives, she finally began to listen to them, realizing the damage that she has done. Slowly, her character begins to grow as she tries to become a better mother. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mädchen Amick</a>, the woman who plays Betty Cooper's mother is actually a very talented actress from the United States of America. She has been acting since 1988 and has been working in Hollywood almost since she moved there in 1987.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Criminal Minds: The Net Worth of The Cast, Past and Present</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=camila-mendes---3-million><strong>Camila Mendes - $3 million</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Camila Mendes</a> is the young lady who plays the elegant and, at first, snooty Veronica Lodge. She and her mother (above) had just moved to Riverdale from New York, and Veronica wasn't very happy about it. Camila brings this role to life, being able to&nbsp;play the brave, young teen to gracefully as she stands up to anything that gets in the way of her and her friends. You can see Camila in&nbsp;The New Romantic,&nbsp;The Perfect Date, and&nbsp;Coyote Lake, even though&nbsp;Riverdale was her first major project in 2017. Talk about a lot of pressure. She handles it well, though!</p><h2 id=kj-apa---3-million><strong>KJ Apa - $3 million</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KJ Apa</a> is the star of the show, playing the man of the hour: Archie Andrews. Now, the show doesn't seem to have one main character, even though the comics did; it seems to be a show surrounding a group of people and their individual problems. So while Archie is not the main character, he still is very important. KJ Apa is, in fact, a bright-eyed actor from New Zealand who moved to Hollywood at a young age, like many of his co-stars. You can see him in other productions such as&nbsp;A Dog's Purpose,&nbsp;The Hate&nbsp;U Give, and&nbsp;The Last Summer. He has also been nominated for five awards, winning one of them!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cole-sprouse---9-million><strong>Cole Sprouse - $9 million</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Cole Sprouse</a> is known for a lot of things, one of them being his major role as Cody in&nbsp;The Suite Life of Zack and Cody,&nbsp;The Suite Life on Deck, and&nbsp;The Suite Life Movie. After finally finishing the franchise in his late teens, he decided to take a break from acting, disappearing from the acting world from 2012 to 2017, where he shows up in&nbsp;Riverdale as Jughead Jones. He plays a mysterious young man who has had a hard life. Fun fact: Cole Sprouse and his co-star, Camila Mendes, actually graduated at the same University, during the same year.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Top 10 Victoria's Secret Angels Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=luke-perry---10-million><strong>Luke Perry - $10 million</strong></h2><p>Archie's father, Fred Andrews, plays a major role in helping the kids figure out what has been going on with the murder of Jason Blossom. He is a kind, giving man who was generous enough to give Jughead Jones a room to sleep in after the place he was staying at (the drive-in movie theater) was destroyed, leaving him homeless. <a href=#>Luke Perry</a> is actually quite a busy guy. When he was a young man, he was declared a 'teen idol' during the time he spent on&nbsp;Beverly Hills 90210 from 1990 to 1995. Throughout the years, he spent time on shows like&nbsp;Will & Grace,&nbsp;Criminal Minds, and&nbsp;The Simpsons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Every Cast Member Of The Good Place’s Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSyt7HRsmScmaOpeq6xzJucq2Wfm3qztdWeqZ2ZnJrAbrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./faze-rains-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html>&#171;&nbsp;FaZe Rains net worth, biography, fact, career, awards and life story</a>
