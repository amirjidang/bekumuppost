But Richert has become a musician in the years since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He often posts about the music that he's making on his Instagram and also shared that he performs at open mics sometimes. Fans can check out his music on his website, including the video he made for his song "Let Me Be Your Fool."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nate Richert talked about his music</a> and told Revamp Magazine, "I love songwriting.

Now that he's well-known for playing this part, he seems to interact with fans of the '90s sitcom as much as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In March 2023, Richert shared that he and his fellow cast members were at '90s Con. It looks like it was a lot of fun and like he enjoyed spending time with his co-stars again. Richert posted a photo with Jenna Leigh Green, who played the school bully Libby, and wrote, "Another one of my favorite people.

If Harvey Kinkle was ever asked if he would try skydiving, he would probably shrug, laugh, and look a bit awkward. He isn't the most adventurous person around. But he might support Sabrina if she decided that she wanted to do it.</p><p>In real life, Nate Richert seems to enjoy skydiving. He posted a photo of him jumping out of a plane a few years ago.

I do improv and songwrite to maintain my sanity.

He said that he figured out how to live with this and be able to be happier.</p><p>The actor said, "Anxiety and subsequent depression were my major game-stoppers.

He also guest-starred in a few TV episodes like Touched By An Angel in 2000 and Fantasy Island in 1998.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is What Caroline Rhea From 'Sabrina The Teenage Witch' Is Doing Now</a></span></p><p>Richert alluded to how his mental health made it tough for him to think that he could act once he was done playing Harvey.
