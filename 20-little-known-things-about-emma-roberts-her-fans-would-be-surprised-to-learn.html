It may have had something to do with the fact that she has one of America’s sweethearts trailblazing the way for her. Not only is her aunt the legendary Julia Roberts, but her father is also actor&nbsp;Eric Roberts. That’s a pretty cool gene pool to jump from and imagine all the great advice she must get about her career. She has proven that she has the acting chops to be in Hollywood and man, can this girl tap into her evil side.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She started off in the industry as a child actor landing small roles in movies like America’s Sweethearts and Blow. Her first leading roles were in Nancy Drew and Aquamarine and they were career-makers for her. Now, she’s getting some pretty cool roles and is making her own career in the industry. Check out these 20 little-known things about Emma Roberts.</p><h2 id=she-s-super-close-to-julia-roberts><strong>She’s Super Close to Julia Roberts</strong></h2><p>We don’t just mean that she’s related to Julia, but that the two have a very close relationship as well. Imagine being able to say that you were playing cards with a superstar like Julia Roberts. But to Emma of course, it’s just Aunt Julia, she doesn’t see her in the same way as the rest of us do. She felt “spellbound” when she was on the set of Erin Brockovich. "I would hide," Emma said.</p><p><strong>"I'd run and hide in her makeup trailer and hear, 'Where's Emma? It's time for bed! She has to go home!'</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I remember it feeling like summer camp, just the feeling of creativity."</p><h2 id=she-released-an-album><strong>She Released An Album</strong></h2><p>Did you know Emma could sing? She unleashed her vocals on her former Nickelodeon show&nbsp;Unfabulous. She released her album called Unfabulous and More and it surprisingly reached number 46 on the Billboard charts. She has a lot more talent than people give her credit for and it looks like she’s a double threat. “I think it's important to have as many experiences as possible in life because one day you won't be able to do it anymore.”</p><h2 id=julia-roberts-doesn-t-like-american-horror-story><strong>Julia Roberts Doesn’t Like American Horror Story</strong></h2><p>We know Emma Roberts has been a regular on American Horror Story and she can’t get her famous aunt to take a guest spot on the show. "I try to support my Emma, but I don't like it," Julia said to E! Online. She doesn’t want to be on the show either. "I'll tell you why—because I can't even get through the commercials," Roberts explained. "I am the most fitful scaredy cat. When the first American Horror Story came out, remember the first poster? I said to [show co-creator Ryan Murphy], 'Okay, I curse you. I stop at a traffic light and I have to look at that thing on billboards. It gives me the willies. What is that? What is going on? What have you done?'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-has-her-own-book-club><strong>She Has Her Own Book Club</strong></h2><p>Emma Roberts has stated that she loves to read and will devour a book a week. What you may not be aware of is that she also has a book club. She and a friend decided to start their book club called Belletrist and you can find them on social media sites like Instagram.</p><p><strong>“One of my best friends is named Karah Preiss. We met through mutual friends eight or nine years ago. As we all started hanging out more, the two of us would end up branching off and talking about books.</strong></p><p>We started recommending books to each other — her especially for me, she read more than I did.”</p><h2 id=her-father-has-an-interesting-history><strong>Her Father has an interesting history&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>It’s pretty well known that Eric Roberts is one of the troubled stars in Hollywood, though we don’t see much of him anymore. In 1987, he was involved in a scandal and got in trouble with the law. He also resisted arrest and even threw a punch at a New York onlooker. He spent 36 hours in a cell before he was brought to court.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-loves-to-write><strong>She Loves To Write</strong></h2><p>Although she has stated she’s not sure she would ever get anything published, Emma does enjoy writing.</p><p><strong>“Joan Didion actually says that there are certain children that can't help but keep a notebook and obsessively write in it. And I was that child.</strong></p><p>So I'm constantly writing, and I would love to write a book of essays or short stories. I love Slouching Towards Bethlehem and The White Album by Joan Didion. And then Chloe Caldwell, I loved her essays. I think that would be really interesting to get to do.”</p><h2 id=she-had-to-audition-for-her-first-role><strong>She Had to Audition For Her First Role</strong></h2><p>Yes, you might assume with a famous Aunt like Julia Roberts, that Emma would have just been given her roles in Hollywood. But that’s not the case, she had to audition just like everyone else. Her first role was in the movie Blow alongside Johnny Depp. She was only ten at the time and she played the younger version of Jaime King’s character. She got the role and seriously look how cute she was back then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-mother-wanted-her-to-delay-being-an-actress><strong>Her Mother Wanted Her to Delay Being An Actress</strong></h2><p>We all know what can happen to a child who is thrown into acting at a young age. We have seen many actresses and actors over the years crash and burn. Emma’s mother warned her that she should wait until she was older.</p><p><strong>“At every step of her early career, Roberts's mother, Kelly Cunningham, warned her about the consequences of choosing an acting career too young, asking her to delay her ambitions,”</strong></p><p>wrote Allure. Luckily, she seems to be doing just fine.</p><h2 id=she-attended-sarah-lawrence-college-for-a-little-bit><strong>She Attended Sarah Lawrence College for a little bit</strong></h2><p>Even though she had been established in Hollywood as an actress when she turned 20, she still wanted to go to college. She decided to go to the same college Vera Wang and Carrie Fisher attended. She attended Sarah Lawrence College to get an English literature major. She didn’t get too far, though, because just a few short months later, she decided to put school on hold because her work schedule&nbsp;had become&nbsp;too much. She never did go back and many people wondered if it was because she was scared the jobs would be gone if she stayed away for too long.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-had-issues-with-evan-peters><strong>She&nbsp;had issues with Evan Peters</strong></h2><p>She's been dating Evan Peters for years now, ever since they met while filming American Horror Story. The two definitely seem to be in love, but they have had their struggles over the years. Emma got trouble with the law in 2013 after crossing a line during an argument with Peters. Apparently, she gave Peters a bloody nose and he had bite marks on him. Her father stood up for her saying that "unless you're one of those people [involved], you do not know what happened." Peters refused to press charges and they are still together to this day.</p><h2 id=her-grandmother-is-an-acting-coach><strong>Her Grandmother is An Acting Coach</strong></h2><p>Emma Roberts has had tremendous support from a family filled with actors. She has a lot of people who can help her out in the industry and that includes a grandmother who is an acting coach. It may be why both Eric and Julia got into acting to begin with. Betty Lou Bredemus was also an actress and she eventually used her talent to coach others. After she had Eric, she started up a workshop called Atlanta Actors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=julia-roberts-always-took-care-of-emma><strong>Julia Roberts&nbsp;always took care of Emma&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Emma’s mother was going for full custody because she didn’t want her daughter to be under Eric’s care. Julia Roberts agreed with it and went against her brother and paid for all the legal expenses for Kelly to win custody of her daughter. That’s how little she thought of her brother&nbsp;— she wasn’t willing to back him up. The two were estranged at one point but they seem to be back in each other’s lives now. She obviously thought it was in Emma’s best interest to be with her mother.</p><h2 id=she-loves-men-who-are-chivalrous><strong>She Loves Men Who Are Chivalrous</strong></h2><p>Don’t we all? When it comes to dating, Emma Roberts is a romantic and she loves grand gestures.</p><p><strong>"I’m not a cynic; I’m a romantic. I’m, like, 'Where’s the grand gesture? Open the door for me!'"</strong></p><p>She knows the reality of dating these days, however. “It’s hard to come by these days,’ she says. She seems rather smitten by Evan Peters so maybe he’s giving her the romance that she needs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-has-been-on-the-best-dressed-list><strong>She Has Been on the Best Dressed List</strong></h2><p>Not all celebrities make great fashion choices. Even her own aunt is someone who has made some fashion blunders from time to time. But Emma seems to be doing pretty well in that category and even made it onto Teen Vogue’s Best Dressed list. It started happening in 2008 when she dyed her hair so dark that it was almost black. It appeared as if she had found herself and with that came some daring looks. She is rarely seen in something that would make the critics shudder.</p><h2 id=following-in-julia-s-footsteps><strong>Following in Julia's footsteps&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Nope, that’s not Julia Roberts in that picture, but it sure looks like it. It’s Emma Roberts and she dressed like her aunt Julia from the movie Pretty Woman&nbsp;for a Halloween contest. We have to wonder if Julia kept the costume and handed it over or if&nbsp;Emma had to&nbsp;put it together herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=julia-worries-about-her-all-the-time><strong>Julia Worries About Her All The Time</strong></h2><p>Family is family and it’s normal for family members to worry about their nieces and nephews. Celebrities are no different and even if though Emma Roberts is all grown up, her Aunt Julia stills worries about her. That’s the sweetest thing we’ve heard all day. “She's so lovely," Julia said to Allure about Emma.</p><p><strong>"We spend a lot of time together. Emma is a remarkable girl.”</strong></p><p>"Sometimes I sort of secretly worry about her," Julia admitted, "And then I see her and go, what am I worried about? She's a solid human being."</p><h2 id=eric-roberts-takes-credit-for-emma-and-julia-s-success><strong>Eric Roberts Takes Credit For Emma and Julia’s Success</strong></h2><p>Eric Roberts loves to boast when he gets the chance and that’s why he has no problem taking the credit for not only Julia’s success, but Emma’s as well. When talking about them he has said,</p><p><strong>"If it wasn't for me, there would be no Julia Roberts and no Emma Roberts as celebrities, as actresses, and I'm very proud of that. When Julia first came to New York, I went into William Morris and I said, 'Which one of you is going to sign my sister Julia?'"</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He added, "And I am so proud that everybody knows I was first, because I was first by a long shot. I was first to get Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations, so I'm proud of that."</p><h2 id=she-eats-what-she-wants-when-she-wants><strong>She&nbsp;eats what she wants, when she wants</strong></h2><p>She is a small girl with a petite frame and we know that Hollywood likes their girls to be thin. Emma, however, does not believe in diets. She tries to go to the gym when she can and enjoys doing yoga. Many actresses will stick to a strict diet, especially when they know they have a photo shoot coming up or a red carpet event, but not Emma. She chose to eat cupcakes a few days before her shoot with Shape magazine and she did it because she wanted to. "With my diet, I eat what feels good for me at the time."</p><h2 id=she-s-not-a-party-girl><strong>She’s Not a Party Girl</strong></h2><p>We’ve seen a lot of young actresses over the years crash and burn because they try to party and work at the same time. Emma Roberts has never been that girl, even if her mom did worry about her living the Hollywood life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“I just never have really been the kind of person that's out in public being inappropriate, I guess. I like to have fun as much as the next person, but I tend to do it in private and just hang out with close friends.</strong></p><p>If I'm going to go out, I'll just do it with my really good friends.”</p><h2 id=she-could-eat-breakfast-all-day><strong>she could eat breakfast all day&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>We might be with her on this one. She loves breakfast and that means, bacons, eggs, and toast. "I adore classic breakfast foods," she has said. She loves it so much that she wouldn’t mind having it as part of some meal every single day. "On my days off, I'll have eggs, bacon, and toast." She sounds like she is just like us and we love it. She is the actress that loves to bring goodies like cupcakes and ice cream to her costars on set as well.</p><p>References:&nbsp;<a href=#>diply.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>dailymail.co.uk,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>allure.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>elle.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYmV6rbXTraOeZZujvLi6jK2foqaXqHqirs6uq2adnaKubr7Om5yrrKNitaa%2BjJ%2BYp6tdrLy2uMNmmZ5lo6q%2Fsb7IrJydZaSkeq2xwKulaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./5-things-you-dont-know-about-vincent-piazza-2011216.html>&#171;&nbsp;5 Things You Don't Know About Vincent Piazza</a>
