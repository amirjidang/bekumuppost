made a name for himself appearing as often lovable and eccentric characters in films such as Raising Arizona, Barton Fink, and The Big Lebowski. The sixty-nine-year-old actor is beloved by fans around the world for his nuanced performances which are often very memorable - and may be known to younger fans more for his roles in The Flintstones, and voice work for The Emperor's New Groove and as Sulley in Monsters Inc.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How John Goodman Really Felt About Rosanne Barr Getting Fired</a></span></p><p>Goodman has been working in the movie industry since the mid-70s, and over that time has landed many big roles in film, stage, and TV. So how much wealth has he garnered over the decades? Just what is his total net worth? Read on to find out.</p><h2 id=how-did-john-goodman-39-s-career-get-off-the-ground><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>How Did John Goodman's Career Get Off The Ground?</span></h2><p>Before he became an actor, John attended Southwest Missouri State University on a football scholarship.</p><p>After graduating college with an (appropriate) theater degree, he made the decision to move to New York City and follow his dreams. It wasn't long before he was acting in off-Broadway plays.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=john-goodman-39-s-big-break-came-with-39-roseanne-39><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>John Goodman's Big Break Came With 'Roseanne'</span></h2><p>Though Goodman had been acting since the mid-70s, Goodman's career really began to take off in the mid-1980s when he landed the plum role of Dan Conner in TV show Roseanne, which ran from 1988 to 1997. The series explores the difficulties faced by a typical American family, the Conners, as they struggle with limited funds. The show was a huge hit with critics and audiences alike, and went on to gain awards for its realistic portrayal of a blue-collar family and unusual insistence for the era of including gay characters onscreen.</p><p>He is still playing Dan Conner today on The Conners, the spin-off of the Roseanne reboot that ABC developed after <a href=#>Roseanne Barr was fired from the show</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-have-been-big-changes-in-recent-years-for-john-goodman><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>There Have Been Big Changes In Recent Years For John Goodman</span></h2><p>Goodman is known for his large frame and commanding presence. However, in recent years he decided to change things drastically and to completely overhaul his lifestyle. Goodman lost an immense amount of weight, and appears almost unrecognizable in recent pictures.</p><p>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In the old days, I would take three months out, lose 60 or 70 pounds, and then reward myself with a six-pack or whatever and just go back to my old habits</a>,” he told ABC News.</p><p>Goodman continued: "This time, I wanted to do it slowly. Move, exercise. I’m getting to the age where I can’t afford to sit still anymore."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Inside John Goodman And His Wife Anna Beth's Sweet Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=john-goodman-has-faced-significant-personal-difficulties-in-his-life><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>John Goodman Has Faced Significant Personal Difficulties In His Life</span></h2><p>Despite his persona as a happy-go-lucky guy, Goodman has struggled with mental health issues and alcoholism over the years. Alcohol, he says, began to take over his life, and he decided it was time to change.</p><p>"It was getting to be too much," he said in an interview with The Guardian. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It was 30 years of a disease that was taking its toll on everyone around me</a> and it had got to the point where, every time I did it, it was becoming more and more debilitating. It was life or death. It was time to stop."</p><p>Alcohol was severely affecting his work. How? "Temperament. Memory. Depression."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>John Goodman & 9 Other Incredible Actors Who Have Never Won An Oscar</a></span></p><h2 id=how-much-is-john-goodman-worth-today><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>How Much Is John Goodman Worth Today?</span></h2><p>Given the enormous success which he has enjoyed over the years, it comes as perhaps no surprise that Goodman is worth an immense amount. In fact, according to WealthyPersons.com, he is worth an estimated $75 million. Acting fees, which have been large in value for his biggest projects, as well as some other ventures, have resulted in a very healthy bank account for the veteran actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All this wealth means Goodman has been able to invest in some prime real estate. According to Celebrity Net Worth, in 2007, he paid $4.6 million for a 5-bedroom home in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles, California. Likewise, in 2005, he also bought the Joseph Merrick Jones House in New Orleans for $1.8 million; the 4,900 square foot home once belonged to Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. In 1996, John sold his Encino, California, home to actor David Hasselhoff for $1.98 million, sold a Hollywood Hills house for $560,500, and paid $875,000 for a home in Calabasas.</p><h2 id=there-is-however-some-discrepancy-about-john-goodman-39-s-net-worth><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>There Is, However, Some Discrepancy About John Goodman's Net Worth</span></h2><p>While Goodman is without a doubt worth many millions of dollars, the precise amount varies between sources. While Wealthy Persons gives the figure at $75 million, some estimates are significantly lower. For instance, Celebrity Net Worth claims Goodman is worth only $45 million, but does note a breakdown of his net worth. His work on The Conners, for example, means he earns around $400,000 per episode, working out to around $8 million per season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Goodman's true net worth most likely lies somewhere between these two values. His hard work over the years has made him one of the richest actors working in the industry at this time.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's Why Jeff Bridges Made His Eyes Red In 'The Big Lebowski'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKCeYrSwu8OmmKdllqS8ta7ApaNmqJyWxqa%2BjJqaraeiYrumwIywpqusmGQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ikere-postal-or-zip-codes-ekiti-state.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ikere Postal or Zip codes (Ekiti State)</a>
