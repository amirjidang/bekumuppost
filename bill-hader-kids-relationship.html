He played the main character in the dark HBO comedy&nbsp;Barry&nbsp;and people were also interested when he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">used to date Rachel Bilson</a>. Some fans might not even know that he has kids as the focus is often on his comedy, but he has three daughters with his ex-wife, Maggie Carey.</p><p>What is Bill Hader's relationship like with his kids? Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=a-tough-time>A Tough Time</h2><p>Every day, it seems like there are articles airing celebrities' dirty laundry, but sometimes, the stars themselves will admit when they've been having a difficult time.</p><p>In July 2020,&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;reported that Bill Hader and Rachel Bilson had broken up, which is sad news since&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the couple seemed totally in love.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The previous summer, Bill Hader went through a rough period, proving that his relationship with his children hasn't always been 100&nbsp;percent perfect or all rainbows and butterflies, and he has been open about it.</p><p>In the summer of 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hader said he was with his kids for five days</a>. According to&nbsp;People, he was shooting&nbsp;It: Chapter&nbsp;2&nbsp;along with working on the scripts for season two of&nbsp;Barry.</p><p>Hader said,&nbsp;“I think I saw my kids a total of five days all summer. It was terrible." He continued, "I’m going, ‘Next summer I’m taking off. And I’m going to spend every day with them.' It’s this weird thing where when you’re in this industry, you don’t have time to be with them, and it’s really, really difficult. I’m getting emotional right now talking about it." He really did cry in the interview and joked that he had never done that before.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About Pete Davidson’s Time On SNL</a></span></p><h2 id=hader-s-family-life>Hader's Family Life</h2><p>Hader and Carey's daughters are named Hayley (six years old), Harper (eight years old), and Hannah (who is 11).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From the way that the actor talks about his kids, and the fact that he teared up while talking about not seeing them enough one summer, it's clear that he loves them so much.</p><p>Hader once shared a cute story about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hannah learning about the tooth fairy</a>. According to&nbsp;The Huffington Post, he said that he filmed his daughter's reaction to losing a tooth and&nbsp;hearing about the tooth fairy. He said to her, "Hey, Hannah, the tooth fairy came, oh, my gosh."</p><p>As it turned out, his younger daughter, Harper, got really upset. She asked, "Someone was in our house?" and he said it was the tooth fairy. She said, "Someone was in my room? While I was sleeping? And you guys are cool with this?" This is so funny to hear about, since a lot of the time, kids simply accept that there's a tooth fairy and they like getting the money for losing a tooth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;The Huffington Post, Hader also said that a famous actor told him that he stars on his own TV show, that'll enable him to be home more and see his children more often. He said that when he's away working, he keeps in touch with his kids over FaceTime but it's definitely not the same thing. He said, "You’d rather just be there, though.

According to&nbsp;Cheat Sheet, when he was filming It Chapter 2, they asked if he could put Pennywise on FaceTime so they could see and talk to the scary clown.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hader said that, of course, he was worried that&nbsp;It&nbsp;would be too intense for his little ones, so he had them watch&nbsp;The Sandlot.
