But when it comes to the relationships that happened behind the scenes of the movie, it's Julia Stiles who was the center of it all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FCD05372-CF3A-40F5-AF49-72242D160FFD.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The director of 10 Things I Hate About You, Gil Junger, was interviewed on Mirá a Quién Encontré, a YouTube series, and said that Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Julia Stiles were in a relationship. Gordon-Levitt played the adorable Cameron James and Stiles played Bianca's sometimes mean and prickly older sister Kat. The characters are totally different from one another, with Cameron being innocent and unsure of himself and Kat believing that she's too cool for school.</p><p>According to Grazia Magazine, Gil Junger shared that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stiles and Gordon-Levitt liked each other</a> while they filmed the movie. He said, “She, for a minute or 10, went out with Joseph Gordon-Levitt. They were very, very attracted to each other, which was cool." He added, "I know, right? Isn’t that funny? She’s, like, professing her love to Heath, and she’s in love with the guy who’s waiting in his trailer to shoot the next scene. Yeah, but watching them, it was beautiful how much they enjoyed each other.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/10-things-i-hate-about-you-joseph-gordon-levitt.jpg><p>This is interesting to hear about, given the strong love story between Kat and Patrick, including Patrick's grand gesture near the end of the movie when he sings "I Can't Keep My Eyes Off Of You," which Frankie Valli recorded. The characters are both rebellious, which is what initially draws them to each other. The storyline is a great example of the romance trope of making a bet and how often characters will end up falling in love for real.</p><p>While Gordon-Levitt's character Cameron has eyes for Bianca and they are the ones who end up falling in love by the end of the movie, it's sweet hearing that he and Stiles had real-life chemistry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Joseph Gordon-Levitt Celebrates ‘10 Things I Hate About You’ Anniversary With Rare Cast Photo</a></span></p><p>It sounds like the co-stars kept this quiet during filming as it was many years before the director shared the news of their romance and people began hearing about it. It's hard to know if they would have been able to keep this a secret if the movie was filmed today, given how much is shared on social media.</p><p>Julia Stiles attended Columbia University and studied English, and she finished college in 2005. She shared in an interview with Rolling Stone in 2001 that she lived on the same dorm floor as Joseph Gordon-Levitt. She said of him, “We’re friends. We say hello to each other.” She didn't mention that she dated her co-star in this interview, though, and it doesn't appear that Stiles has spoken about dating Gordon-Levitt in any interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Does-Julia-Stiles-Regret-About-Her-Career.jpg><p>However, Stiles has shared her happy memories of filming 10 Things I Hate About You. She has also explained that she feels a bit awkward watching the movie. The actress told People in 2019,</p><p>“If you had your prom video or a home video from high school, I don’t know that I’d watch it. I usually just look away. I’m glad that people enjoyed it and I’m glad that they’re still talking about it. I don’t take that for granted, but I look away pretty quickly.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=was-julia-stiles-dating-her-10-things-i-hate-about-you-co-star-heath-ledger>Was Julia Stiles Dating Her 10 Things I Hate About You Co-Star Heath Ledger?</h2><p>According to E!

They also said that before Ledger, Stiles hadn't kissed any actor onscreen. However, Stiles hasn't come out and said that she dated Ledger, and it doesn't appear that he spoke about the relationship before his death, either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/10-things-i-hate-about-you-heath-ledger-julia-stiles.jpg><p>It's sweet to imagine the actors having romantic feelings while the cameras were rolling since their characters feel so strongly for one another. 10 Things I Hate About You is such a great comedy because the characters feel realistic, which can't always be said of teen movies which have a tendency to be over the top or too cheesy. And part of that realism is how Kat and Patrick both resist how they feel and try to seem cool and calm but eventually, they realize that it's okay to care about someone else.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why We Don't Hear About Julia Stiles Anymore</a></span></p><p>While rewatching 10 Things I Hate About You and knowing that Julia Stiles dated Joseph Gordon-Levitt dated makes the movie even more charming, it's also possible to watch it thinking that Stiles and Ledger would make a great real-life couple as well.

He said, "We just hung out together. What happened on '10 Things' set, carried over to our off-screen relationships. You could talk to Heath about anything: He was wise beyond his years. David, Joey and Julia were all crazy Beastie Boys fans. Gabrielle was just the coolest. David and Joseph supplied the comic relief. Larisa was a delight.
