traveling the world that comes to mind first and foremost. For that reason, it is understandable that a lot of people seem to think of celebrities as being on a different level than everyone else in life. On the other hand, that kind of thinking can make people feel ok about treating stars’ private lives as fodder for entertainment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Inside Melanie Griffith And Daughter Dakota Johnson's Relationship</a></span></p><p>Ever since tabloids became incredibly popular and then were replaced by gossip websites, some people have considered keeping track of <a href=#>the biggest celebrity breakups</a> every year fun. On top of that, that perception has been cemented further by <a href=#>stars who seemingly love writing harsh breakup songs</a> that the public is supposed to delight in. However, when celebrity couples split up, the people involved and their loved ones are deeply affected. For example, when Antonio Banderas and Melanie Griffith got divorced, that was a major event in the life of their daughter Stella. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, what is Stella doing now?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-stella-banderas-close-to-her-famous-parents-and-sister-now>Is Stella Banderas Close To Her Famous Parents And Sister Now?</h2><p>Sadly, there are far too many families that have been torn apart once the parents get divorced. Thankfully, however, it certainly is possible for families to remain close-knit after divorce as long as the people involved are willing to do the work. When it comes to the family of Melanie Griffith and Antonio Banderas, they seem to have remained close from all accounts.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Inside Melanie Griffith And Daughter Dakota Johnson's Relationship</a></span></p><p>For proof of the fact that the Griffith/Banderas family remains close, all you have to do is look at <a href=#>Dakota Johnson and Antonio Banderas’ ongoing relationship</a>. After all, since Antonio and Dakota aren’t genetically related, they could have stopped being a part of each other’s lives once he technically wasn’t her step-dad anymore. However, as Antonio once told US Weekly while talking about Dakota, "She’s my daughter, I love her. I’ve been with her on my shoulders, traveling all around the world.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Dakota Johnson's Childhood</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, even though Antonio Banderas and Dakota Johnson still have a tight bond doesn’t mean that he gets along with his daughter Stella or she is close with her mother Melanie Griffith. However, when Stella accompanied Antonio to the San Sebastion Film Festival and they wore matching outfits, it said a lot about her relationship with both of her parents. After all, while Melanie wasn’t at the event, she posted an image of her ex-husband and daughter on Instagram along with a loving caption.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fact that Stella Banderas and Melanie Griffith seemingly still have a very tight bond says a lot. After all, in late-2021 Stella made a choice that easily could have caused a rift in her relationship with her mom. When she was born, Antonio Banderas and Melanie Griffith’s daughter was named Stella Banderas Griffith. However, in 2021 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stella filed to have Griffith removed from her legal name</a>. In the resulting court documents, Stella explained her decision to drop Griffith from her name.</p><p>According to her court documents, Stella wanted "to shorten my name by removing the extra last name". As Stella explains in the paperwork “I typically do not use "Griffith" when referring to myself or on documents. So, dropping the name would match my regular use." While all of that makes practical sense, a lot of parents would be profoundly hurt by their child’s decision to drop their last name but that doesn’t seem to be the case for Stella and her mom Melanie. In an interesting twist, despite her court filing, Stella’s Instagram account continues to include the last name Griffith several months after she filed the paperwork.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-stella-banderas-do-for-a-living>What Does Stella Banderas Do For A Living?</h2><p>If anyone googles “what does Stella Banderas do for a living”, the response they will get is that she is an actor. On the one hand, there is some truth to that. After all, Stella played a role in a film that her dad Antonio Banderas directed and her mom Melanie Griffith starred in titled Crazy in Alabama. However, that movie came out in 1999. More recently, in 2019 Stella appeared in a lip-sync video for the song “If You Were Mine” by Ocean Park Standoff which basically amounts to starring in a music video. However, despite those credits, calling Stella an actor is a major stretch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In reality, it seems a lot more accurate to call Stella Banderas a model as she has been paid to take part in photoshoots several times in the past. For example, in 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stella posed for a marketing campaign for the company 101p100</a> in which she wore clothes made from “regenerated nylon”. For those that don’t know what that means, the company has offered the following explanation.</p><p>“All products are made from 100% ECONYL® regenerated nylon, which is made by recovering nylon waste - such as fishing nets from the oceans and aquaculture, fabric scraps from mills and industrial plastic. It reduces the global warming impact of nylon by up to 90% compared with the material from oil.” In the past, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stella has also graced the cover of Glamour Spain</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Melanie Griffith And Antonio Banderas' 25-Year-Old Daughter, Stella</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecCnq6immaR6o63NnZyrmaNirq%2BwjKacpZmenrJus9GinZ%2BhpJ3AbrDArp6hrJWnerTAxKWjmmWUpLavs4ynprBn</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-is-the-farthest-east-city.html>&#171;&nbsp;What is the farthest east city</a>
