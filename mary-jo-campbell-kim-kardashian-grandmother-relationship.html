Although the 88-year-old isn't a regular on Keeping Up with the Kardashians and The Kardashians, she has made several guest appearances on their respective shows over the years and is a solid fan favorite.</p><p>Best known for her bluntness and dry sense of humor, Mary Jo Campbell is clearly adored by her children and grandchildren. MJ has a close relationship with her granddaughters, with the Kardashian-Jenner girls often posting tributes to their Grandmother on mother's day and on her birthdays over the years. Here's the truth about Kim Kardashian's relationship with her grandmother...</p><h2 id=inside-kim-kardashian-39-s-relationship-with-her-grandmother-mary-jo-campbell>Inside Kim Kardashian's Relationship With Her Grandmother, Mary Jo Campbell</h2><p>While many people would find it strange to share the details of their intimate lives with their grandparents, Kim Kardashian is no such person. On Season 2, Episode 4 of the Kardashians, Kim revealed that she and her then-boyfriend Pete Davidson <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">used a fireplace intimacy tip</a> personally recommended by her Grandmother MJ.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim was visiting her mom and grandmother when she revealed that Mary Jo Campbell raved about the pleasures of intimacy in front of a fire.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Kim Kardashian Subtly Take Shots At Pete Davidson And Emily Ratajkowski During Their Brief Fling?</a></span></p><p>"You know what's so crazy?" Kim began "Pete and I were staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel last weekend, sitting in front of the fireplace just talking for hours. 'I was like, my grandma told me that you really live life when you have sex in front of a fireplace'. So we had sex in front of the fireplace in honor of you." Kim told MJ.</p><p>While many Grandmothers might have felt uncomfortable at this risqué statement, MJ only had one question to ask Kim. "Not in the lobby?" MJ jokingly asked, causing both Kim and Khloe to laugh. "But how creepy, to think about your grandma before you have sex" Kim added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar.jpg><p>"I know, but I was younger once" Campbell reassured Kim, showing how open-minded her views are regarding the discussion of her granddaughter's intimate life.</p><h2 id=mary-jo-campbell-has-shown-a-lighthearted-approach-to-her-granddaughter-39-s-controversial-lifestyle>Mary Jo Campbell Has Shown A Lighthearted Approach To Her Granddaughter's Controversial Lifestyle</h2><p>Kim shared an old wedding photo of her grandmother on Instagram with the caption "I just found this pic of my beautiful Grandma MJ at her 1st wedding. It lasted 2.5 months and her family spent all they had on this wedding. She felt so bad but followed her heart. Kinda sounds familiar lol."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim was clearly referencing her infamously short marriage to her ex-husband Kris Humphries which lasted a total of 72 days. Just 72 days after their extravagant wedding ceremony held at a private Californian Estate, Kim Kardashian filed for divorce from the former Professional Basketball player Humphries - causing no shortage of backlash from viewers and critics alike.</p><p>However, It seems like Kim has long since moved past this chapter in her life, now being able to freely joke about the brief marriage with her Grandmother MJ, who experienced a similar experience.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian Thinks 'Fourth Time Will Be The Charm' With Marriage</a></span></p><p>"She always taught me to follow my heart and do what I want to do no matter what!" Kim concluded, once again showing how supportive MJ is towards her famous granddaughter.

We both got married for two months once" the SKIMS creator joked, before Campbell added "We have so much in common. History repeats itself."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar46843963-2.jpg><p>"I can't believe it because I was married for two months at 18. Right out of high school, I was given an engagement ring from a guy I had been going out with for four years." the grandmother began.</p><p>"And I just thought, 'You know what?' this isn't really that much fun' so I got out of it. I shouldn't waste his time".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Yes, I get it Grandma! I feel you" Kim enthusiastically agreed.</p><p>MJ brought up the pair's short marriage history again in a 2021 interview with her daughter Kris Jenner. In a Youtube Video titled 'An Emotional Interview With MJ' Kris Jenner asked her mother who she shared her first kiss with. MJ was quick to answer "I married him, but we were only married for two months. Less than Kimmy" instantly earning laughs from Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner in response.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Kim-Kardashian-Kids.jpg><p>It's clear that not only does MJ approve of Kim Kardashian's controversial lifestyle, but she fully supports Kim, and it is evident in the close relationship that the two have with one another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, their unconventional relationship has certainly attracted naysayers. Kim took to Instagram to post a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">now-deleted bikini photo alongside her Grandmother MJ</a>. While many appreciated how close the pair were, others were quick to slam Kim for being "inappropriate" with her Grandmother. "Imagine taking a photo like this with your Grandma?" one commenter questioned, "Total lack of respect" another wrote.</p><p>While they certainly can't please everyone, it's clear that Kim and her Grandmother MJ share a very close and open-minded relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqqpYrewecKapKmalaG5brfIpmSkmaKZrrS0yJqlZp%2Bilruluc6tn56qXaeyra3Toqanq5ievXA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-is-amanda-bynes-doing-in-2023-actor-placed-on-psychriatic-hold-after-roaming-streets-naked-601057-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;What is Amanda Bynes doing in 2023?
