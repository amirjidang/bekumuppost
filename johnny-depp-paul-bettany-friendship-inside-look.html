"As these are private texts there was a lot… in context," Depp said about the messages. "It’s important to know none of that was ever intended to be real, and the language used which… yes, I am ashamed [of] has to be spread on the world like peanut butter."</p><p>Bettany also opened up about the exchange, adding that it is embarrassing. "I know how this works. Anything that you say is oxygen for a fire. And there’s just no f--king fire," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bettany said</a>. "The only real way to deal with this elegantly is to say: I’m not sure there’s anybody who has one of these devices that would feel comfortable having a team of lawyers scour their private text messages."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=johnny-depp-and-paul-bettany-are-both-around-the-same-age><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Johnny Depp And Paul Bettany Are Both Around The Same Age</span></h2><p>Besides the fact that they work in the same industry, the two are also close in age.
