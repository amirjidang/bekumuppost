Is it because she is among the country’s richest? Or is fame the primary criterion? Or is beauty the number one consideration? On the other hand, some may define a socialite as somebody who is young and gorgeous, while some may argue that a socialite is one who is a party animal and makes moneys from her public appearances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;Or is she somebody who is the favorite wild girl of the paparazzi, known for their attention-seeking ways and weird actions, a “celebutante” with no particular talent at all? Or is she somebody who is just famous for being famous, especially in this Internet age where the cult of celebrity (or notoriety, depending on how you look at it) reigns?</p><p>People may be fighting forever for the precise definition of what a Hollywood socialite is, but here are celebrities who are widely regarded in the media as among the most famous Hollywood socialites.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=10-heidi-montag><strong>10. Heidi Montag</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Heidi Montag is one of the prime examples of celebrities who are famous mainly for wrong reasons. She first appeared in a reality show reviled by critics but became famous among viewers. She met her soon-to-husband Spencer Pratt in the said series. Their antics in the show and public appearances afterwards in other reality shows were viewed with negative media attention. She also became more known after her sex tape came out, no thanks to her husband Pratt.Montag tried launching a music career but was panned by critics. She received further negative publicity when in 2010 when she underwent several plastic surgery procedures in just one day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=9-kelly-killoren-bensimon><strong>9.

Tori Spelling</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Born to legendary television and film producer and writer Aaron Spelling, Tori Spelling is already exposed in television at an early age.

Tara Reid</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tara Reid is another American model and actress whose initial fame went on a sudden bizarre turn, leaping from one of the next big things in Tinseltown to become one of the negative mainstays of American tabloids.Reid was initially known for her TV shows such as <i>Saved By The Bell: The New Class</i>, <i>Days of Our Lives</i>, and <i>Scrubs</i>. She became more known in the popular movies such as <i>American Pie</i> and <i>American Pie 2</i>.

Since then, she hardly headlined any theatrical films intended for wide release and instead starred in low-budgeted films, direct-to-video films, and a TV reality show that was immediately canceled, among others.She became tabloid fodder for her plastic surgeries, wild parties, and string of failed romances in and outside the country.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=6-lauren-katherine-conrad><strong>6.
