Hank Green became a father in October 2016. Hank Green lives with his wife and child in Missoula Montana. In 2006 it was discovered that Hank Green has health problems. He is suffering from ulcerative colitis.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hank-green-brotherhank-green-and-john-green></span><span>Hank Green&nbsp; Brother|Hank Green&nbsp; and John Green</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>John Green </strong>is an American author and YouTube content creator. He won the 2006 Printz Award for his debut novel, Looking for Alaska, and his fourth solo novel, The Fault in Our Stars, debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller list in January 2012.</p><p>In June 2015, the brothers started a weekly podcast titled Dear Hank & John. Taking a mainly humorous tone, each podcast opens with John reading a poem that he selected for the week before the brothers read a series of questions submitted by listeners and offering their advice. The podcast now opens with a “dad joke” from Hank and something John would have tweeted during the week (he is currently taking a year away from social media). The podcast closes with a news segment with two standard topics: Mars, presented by Hank, and AFC Wimbledon, presented by John. On several occasions, one of the brothers was absent from several episodes (for example, during the publicity tours for Paper Towns, Turtles Down, and An Remarkable Thing); various friends and family members of the brothers filled in on those occasions.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hank-green-net-worth></span><span>Hank Green Net Worth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Hank Green is an American entrepreneur, musician, and vlogger who has a net worth of $12 million</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hank-green-missoulawhere-does-hank-green-live></span><span>Hank Green Missoula|Where Does Hank Green Live?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Green resides in Missoula, Montana with his wife, Katherine Green.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hank-green-crash-course></span><span>Hank Green Crash Course</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Crash Course (sometimes stylized as CrashCourse) is an educational YouTube channel started by John and Hank Green (collectively the Green brothers), who first achieved notability on the YouTube platform through their VlogBrothers channel.</p><p>Crash Course was one of the hundred initial channels funded by YouTube’s $100 million original channel initiative. The channel launched a preview on December 2, 2011, and as of August 2019, it has accumulated over 9.7 million subscribers and 1.10 billion video views. The channel launched with John and Hank presenting their respective World History and Biology series; the early history of the channel continued the trend of John and Hank presenting humanities and science courses, respectively. In November 2014, Hank announced a partnership with PBS Digital Studios, which would allow the channel to produce more courses. As a result, multiple additional hosts joined the show to increase the number of concurrent series.</p><p>To date, there are 38 main series of Crash Course, of which John has hosted nine and Hank has hosted seven. Together with Emily Graslie, they also co-hosted Big History. A second channel, Crash Course Kids, is hosted by Sabrina Cruz and has completed its first series, Science. The first foreign-language course, an Arabic reworking of the original World History series, is hosted by Yasser Abumuailek. The main channel has also begun a series of shorter animated episodes, called Recess, that focus on topics from previous Crash Course series.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hank-green-book-hank-green-an-absolutely-remarkable-thing></span><span>Hank&nbsp; Green&nbsp; Book | Hank Green An Absolutely Remarkable Thing</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>An n Absolutely Remarkable Thing is a novel by Hank Green. It was published on September 25, 2018, and is Green’s debut novel. Announced on September 19, 2017, the novel is the first of a two-book deal.</p><p>Protagonist April May discovers a large robot sculpture in Midtown Manhattan. She and her friend Andy Skampt decide to film it and post the video online, which goes viral and makes April an overnight celebrity. All over the world identical structures—known as “Carls”—have appeared in major cities at the same time.</p><p>Several governments restrict access to Carls, leading April to become more politically active, which leads to April being interviewed on one news show alongside the conservative pundit Peter Petrawicki, who has written an already bestselling 20-page book called Invaded arguing that the Carls, representing a foreign invader, could be dangerous. For the following months, April cultivates a friendly persona, and writes her book, saying that people should positively use the social internet to work together at solving the sequences, some of which require specific knowledge and collaboration.</p><p>April then tries to solve the final clue, a unique sequence only she has access to, which would complete the vector image. After she discloses to the public that the 767 sequence exists, Robin tells her that the Defenders have solved it. Miranda gives April the apparent solution: a nearby address and the words, “Only April. No One Else.” In her haste to beat the Defenders to the solution, April rushes to the address against Maya’s advice, where she finds a large empty warehouse. She live-streams herself on Facebook, expecting to communicate with Carl. The warehouse is a trap, however, the product of tampered hex numbers.</p><p>April is locked in the warehouse, which becomes engulfed in flames. Facebook commentators realize that the lyrics to a song playing in the warehouse—David Bowie’s “Golden Years”—have been changed to say, “In every town around the world each of us must be touched with gold”. In an epiphany, April tells her a hundred-million-strong worldwide audience to touch a sample of gold to each of the Carls simultaneously. The police tell April to break a window and jump out, but after she does so, a burning wooden beam falls on, crushes, and presumably kills April.</p><p>April, suddenly transported into the Dream, talks to Carl and learns that Carl indeed arrived to observe humanity. Besides, Carl specifically picked April to make the First Contact.</p><p>In the real world, all 64 Carls worldwide launch themselves into the air and disappear. In the next few weeks, the world reacts to April’s death, and The Defenders are completely discredited for their actions. Eventually, the world returns to normal. Months later, Andy hears a knock at his door and receives a text from April saying, “Knock Knock”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hank-green-book-tour></span><span>Hank Green Book Tour</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2008, John and Hank met up with their fans, known as “Nerdfighters”. The first gathering was a last-minute decision, but despite the short three-day notice, nearly a hundred people attended. In August, John and Hank were invited to the Google office in Chicago to talk about the project. That same day, they filled the Harold Washington Library with about four hundred young adults. Following John’s book tour for his third novel, Paper Towns, the brothers went on a national tour in November. With events in 17 different cities, they met Nerdfighters at local libraries and community centers. During this tour, Green released his first album of Nerdfighter-themed songs, titled So Jokes.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hank-green-scishow></span><span>Hank Green SciShow</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Green created the science YouTube channel SciShow in January 2012, which, like Crash Course, was also initially funded by the online video website. The channel features a series of videos focused on several scientific fields such as chemistry, physics, and biology, as well as interviews and trivia shows with experts. Green aims for SciShow’s content to be approachable and to dispel the idea that science is an inherently difficult subject. Like Crash Course, SciShow is meant to be supplementary to the traditional educational experience, with Green’s goal being “to be good at one thing so teachers can be good at other things.”</p><p>SciShow is primarily hosted by Green, though it has since expanded with <strong>Michael Aranda</strong> taking on additional hosting duties, as well as with occasional appearances by Lindsey Doe and Emily Graslie. A spin-off channel, SciShow Space, was launched in April 2014 to cover space topics,[30] and is hosted by Green, Reid Reimers, and Caitlin Hofmeister. A third channel, SciShow Kids, premiered on March 2015. It is aimed at 3- to 6-year-olds and is hosted by Jessi Knudsen Castañeda. Late in 2016, its patrons on Patreon chose a topic for a new channel, SciShow Psych, which launched in March 2017. It is hosted by Hank Green and Brit Garner who teach about the human brain and aim to provide clear and reputable psychology information.</p><p>The channel has amassed a large audience, with its videos being regularly featured on several media outlets. Green and SciShow were granted a national advertisement deal with YouTube that featured promotion on billboards and television commercials. The channel has been praised as “informative, casual without being condescending, and funny,” though it has been criticized for providing biased information on genetic modification, which was later addressed in a video.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hank-green-lizzie-bennet-diaries></span><span>Hank Green Lizzie Bennet Diaries</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Lizzie Bennet Diaries is an American web series adapted from Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice. The story is conveyed in the form of vlogs. It was created by Hank Green and Bernie Su, produced by Jenni Powell and stars Ashley Clements, Mary Kate Wiles, <strong>Laura Spencer,</strong> Julia Cho, and Daniel Vincent Gordh. It premiered on a dedicated YouTube channel on April 9, 2012, and subsequently concluded when the 100th episode was posted on March 28, 2013.</p><p>In 2013, The Lizzie Bennet Diaries became the first web series to win an Emmy, for Outstanding Creative Achievement In Interactive Media – Original Interactive Program.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hank-green-bandhank-green-music></span><span>Hank Green Band|Hank Green Music</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>During the Brotherhood 2.0 project, Green accepted a challenge to perform an original song bi-weekly (known as “Song Wednesdays”) and he has continued, though less frequently, to write, record, and perform songs since then. His songs include “I’m Gonna Kill You,” “Baby, I Sold Your Dog on eBay,” and “What Would Captain Picard Do?”. Green’s first successful song was “Accio Deathly Hallows”, which was featured on YouTube’s front page preceding the release of the final Harry Potter book, and has been viewed over one and a half million times.</p><p>Green’s first studio album, So Jokes, was released in 2008 and reached number 22 on the Billboard Top 25 revenue generating albums online. He has since released four other albums: I’m So Bad at This: Live! (2009), This Machine Pwns n00bs (2009), Ellen Hardcastle (2011) which was named for the winner of a 2010 charity raffle, and Incongruent (2014) with his new band, Hank Green and the Perfect Strangers. The album was released on May 7, 2014.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hank-green-and-the-perfect-strangers></span><span>Hank Green And The Perfect Strangers</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Green’s first studio album, So Jokes, was released in 2008 and reached number 22 on the Billboard Top 25 revenue generating albums online.

It was canceled March 2018 after 58 episodes due to regrets about using fuck in the title and wishes to change up the format. In late 2018 the panelists from HFS returned in SciShow Tangents, another podcast with a similar format.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hank-green-podcast></span><span>Hank Green Podcast</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dear Hank & John is a podcast hosted by the Green brothers: musician and author Hank Green and young-adult novelist and film producer John Green. The podcast is produced and edited by Josef “Tuna” Metesh with additional help from Rosianna Halse Rojas. First released in June 2015, Hank and John Green answer questions e-mailed by listeners, give “dubious” advice and talk about the weekly news from the planet Mars and the 3rd tier English football club AFC Wimbledon. Episodes are typically around 45 minutes in length. Upon the podcast’s debut, it reached the number 4 position on the US iTunes performance chart and hit a peak position of number 2 two days later. Dear Hank & John has also been charted on iTunes in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Spain, Australia, and Brazil. The podcast is primarily funded through the crowdfunding website Patreon, though the majority of the pledges go towards the video production budget of Complexly. Since November 2018, the podcast is a co-production of Complexly and WNYC Studios.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hank-green-songs></span><span>Hank Green Songs</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>“Farmville” — Hardcastle</li><li>“My Favorite Pony” — non-album singles</li><li>“My Favorite Pony (Acoustic)” —</li><li>“The Universe is Weird” 2014 —</li><li>“We Are All Bat people”<br>(with John Green featuring The Gregory Brothers) 2015</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hank-green-youtube-channel></span><span>Hank Green Youtube Channel</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hank-green-twitter></span><span>Hank Green Twitter</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tweets by hankgreen</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hank-green-instagram></span><span>Hank Green Instagram</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fna6vt4ygqZ6dnmKvqrvGq5ipoKlirqixjJ%2BYpqGcrnqlscarnJ5lp56zpnnJqJ%2BnZZensqa6jJypmquYYrCwwdGsnGark57AqbvWZqeonJOWwLV50qiloKtdlrulec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./harvey-weinstein-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Harvey Weinstein Net Worth How Much is Weinstein Worth?</a>
