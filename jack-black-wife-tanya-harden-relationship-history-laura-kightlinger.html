Before audiences got to know Jack Black as one half of the rock band Tenacious D and the star of blockbuster films such as School of Rock, Jumanji, and Tropic Thunder, he was a man deeply in love with his high school crush, Tanya Haden.</p><p>Jack Black and Tanya Haden are two accomplished artists in their own right. Still, they are notoriously private, preferring to live everyday life with their two children, away from the glitz and glamour of Tinsel Town.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Black said in an interview in The Guardian</a>, "I don't want to go anywhere anyway. I like to be at home. And I love just hanging poolside with the boys, with Tanya and the boys. A day by the pool, that's a nice day off."

We met at school at 18 - and I wasted 15 years waiting for my chance. She was everything I could wish for: talented, beautiful and a wonderful performer on stage. She was part of a band called The Haden Triplets. We first worked together on a student film, but we did not date. I used to see her and her sisters perform at clubs around town and I would watch from the shadows, mumble some compliments, and shuffle off. So, I would see her only every couple of years."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Jack Black's Parents</a></span></p><p>Decades later, the two got reacquainted, began dating, and eventually engaged.

She has also penned many best-selling books, such as Quick Shots of False Hope: A Rejection Collection, which chronicles Laura Kightlinger's many rejections in her personal and professional life.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> 9 Reasons Why Jack Black Is Beloved By His Fans</a></span></p><p>Laura Kightlinger and Jack Black first encountered each other on the set of the television show Tenacious D, which was a fictional account of Black and bandmate Kyle Gass's rock band of the same name.</p><p>Though the media and ardent fans of Black were aware of their relationship, much of their courtship was kept private. They made only a few media appearances together, most notably on the red carpet at the 76th annual Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles and again at Jack Black's School of Rock premiere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The relationship simultaneously reached its height when Black and Kightlinger got engaged, only to hit its lowest point when the two broke up.
