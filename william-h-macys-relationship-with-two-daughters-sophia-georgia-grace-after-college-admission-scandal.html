While many parents got their children into school in an unethical manner, all eyes were on Lori Loughlin, Felicity Huffman, and William H. Macy since they were the biggest names involved. In the years since the scandal, everyone's lives have shifted. Loughlin's daughter <a href=#>Olivia Jade left college</a> and <a href=#>Huffman and Macy's marriage was affected</a>. While the couple is still married, there is no denying that they have gone through some hard times.</p><p>William H. Macy and Felicity Huffman have two daughters: 21-year-old Georgia Grace Macy and 22-year-old Sophia Grace Macy. Since their daughters have two actors for parents, their family life has never been completely regular. But, of course, the scandal made things more challenging. Here's whether William H. Macy and his kids are close now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-william-h-macy-get-along-with-daughters-georgia-and-sophia-today>Does William H. Macy Get Along With Daughters Georgia And Sophia Today?</h2><p><a href=#>Felicity Huffman began acting again</a> after the scandal, but it sounds like it took a while for her family life to get back on track. When people first found out about the college admissions scandal, Huffman's daughter Sophia Grace Macy understandably wasn't thrilled with her mom. According to People, Sophia didn't know what her mom was doing, and her mom's behavior affected her ability to leave home and go to college as she planned.</p><p>In April 2020, People reported that Sophia was going to Carnegie Mellon University. It was a big moment, and she got in on her own merits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/william-h-macy-felicity-huffman-instagram.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In May 2020, In Touch Weekly reported that Sophia and Felicity Huffman were figuring out a way to be close again. A source told the publication, “The nightmare won’t ever be forgotten, but Felicity is definitely moving forward. She’s admitted her wrongs, spent time behind bars, and now she’s making a living amends to her family.”</p><p>While a lot has been said about Felicity Huffman's relationship with her daughters, what about William H. Macy's?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>William H. Macy Fought To Stay "Humble" After His Experience With Burt Reynolds On Boogie Nights</a></span></p><p>Macy's relationship with his daughters Georgia and Sophia never seemed to suffer because of the scandal. It's possible that this could be because, according to People, Huffman received charges but Macy didn't. But since Georgia and Sophia haven't made statements about their parents or the scandal, no one can say for sure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/william-h-macy-felicity-huffman-kids.jpg><p>In the years that have passed since the college admissions scandal, William H. Macy and Sophia Macy have been photographed together a few times.</p><p>In 2019, The Daily Mail shared photos of the father and daughter in Vancouver, British Columbia. Sophia got an acting role on the TV show When the Street Lights Go On and her dad was there, too. There were pictures of them walking down the street with big smiles on their faces, and they were also holding each other's hands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/what-is-william-h-macy-s-relationship-with-his-two-daughters-like-years-after-the-college-admission-scandal_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In July 2022, The Daily Mail reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Macy and his daughter Sophia were horseback riding</a>. From that article, fans could guess that they have stayed close. Although Macy and Sophia haven't said anything about their relationship in recent years, it seems that they wanted to spend some time together. Perhaps they go horseback riding all the time. They both looked very comfortable with the activity in the photos that were shared online.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Crazy Truth About William H. Macy's Best Scene In Boogie Nights</a></span></p><p>There don't seem to be any photos of Macy with his other daughter, Georgia. Of course, that doesn't mean that they aren't close as well. The media seems to focus more on Sophia since Felicity Huffman bribed people in order for Sophia to be accepted into college.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/felicity-huffman-daughter.jpg><p>Both Georgia and Sophia are in college now. Sophia is still attending CMU and, according to an E! News article from 2019, Georgia goes to Vassar. Georgia, Sophia, and their father haven't said how often they hang out. It's unknown whether Felicity Huffman and William H. Macy visit them at college. But since Georgia and Sophia haven't said anything negative about their dad to the press, fans can guess that everything is cool between them.</p><h2 id=what-has-william-h-macy-said-about-his-daughters-georgia-and-sophia>What Has William H. Macy Said About His Daughters Georgia And Sophia?</h2><p>William H. Macy has talked about his daughters Georgia and Sophia in the past. He has made a few statements that have been surprising for people to hear.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/william-h-macy.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">William H. Macy talked about his daughters</a> in a 2004 interview with Entertainment Tonight and explained that from his perspective, it would be fine if he helped his kids become actors.</p><p>Macy said, "One can help your children in this business, and the nepotism works, and I have no problems with it. If I can give them a leg up, I absolutely would. It's a great way to make a living. It really is."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Crossfit And Insane Training Regimes Got William H.

Given the discussion surrounding "nepo babies" today, Macy's words are even more memorable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/william-h-macy-felicity-huffman.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2018, when Georgia was 16 years old and Sophia was 17 years old, Macy made some more unforgettable statements about his daughters. This time, he talked about their dating lives.</p><p>Macy said “You know, I started doing all the cliches, ‘I’m gonna threaten the guys, I’m gonna dig a moat around our house.' And then I thought, ‘OK, what do you really want for your daughters?’ And I realized: I want them to be happy and lusty and safe." He continued that he hoped his children would have "good, healthy, wonderful" intimate lives.</p><p>Whenever the actor talked about his family before the college admissions scandal, he always sounded happy. In 2017, he was interviewed by Closer Weekly and said that he didn't regret the fact that his daughters were born when he was 50. In fact, he loved that this happened when he was older. Macy said, “I’m glad I did it late in life. I had more patience, and I had money. I didn’t think I’d ever be a father, and boy, do I really like it!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems like Felicity Huffman, William H. Macy, and their daughters Sophia Grace Macy and Georgia Grace Macy have tried to put the scandal behind them. It's fair to say that as of now, their family life is back to the way that it once was.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoqScnq6uecdmpJqbqah6s7HLmquip56otaq8jLCgraBdqcSwecOarKCgpJq%2FtHnSqKehoZFitKa70aCgmmWXp66ksYyana2domKwsLjLnp6eZZGZuqq%2F0qKmp2WjmK6vsMClZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./where-does-kris-jenner-boyfriend-corey-gamble-get-money.html>&#171;&nbsp;Where Does Kris Jenner's BF Corey Gamble Get His Money?</a>
