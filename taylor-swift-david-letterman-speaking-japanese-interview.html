Even back then, fans thought Letterman's admiration for Taylor Swift was evident, and that continues to hold true today.</p><p>Looking back at their conversations from the past, there were a couple of surprising moments. One of them included Swift being able to speak in Japanese. At first, both Letterman and the audience were skeptical, but Swift backed up her words in a major way.</p><p>We'll take a look back at how it all went down, while also putting the spotlight on how the fans felt about the interview.

Even then, Taylor Swift was so well-spoken during interviews, and that included the ones that featured the biggest pressure, like on The Late Show with David Letterman. During this particular chat, Swift discussed her songwriting process, while also bringing up how she tours the world and adapts to the settings that she's in.</p><p>However, fans and David Letterman himself did not expect Swift to discuss how she adapts in Japan, and is able to speak the language.</p><p>Swift tells Letterman, "I always try to adapt myself a little bit by learning a few phrases. Sometimes it fails miserably. But when I'm in Japan, I'm speaking Japanese the entire show." Letterman responds, "No you don't."</p><p>Swift continues, "I don't sing in Japanese, but I could speak in Japanese. I mean you just memorize some of it and then figure out what it means."</p><p>Swift would go on to say some of the Japanese phrases, which were met by a "wow" from Letterman and an applause from the audience. Swift would go on to reveal what she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"First I said, 'Are you having fun Osaka.' Then I said, 'I love Japan.' Then I said, 'Japan is awesome.' And then I said, 'Cute.'"</p><p>Both David Letterman and the audience got a real kick out of the moment.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/your-paragraph-text-2024-04-25t123808-102.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Moment David Letterman Thought Billie Eilish Was Fed Up With Him During Their Interview ">The Moment David Letterman Thought Billie Eilish Was Fed Up With Him During Their Interview</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>David Letterman appeared was flustered during a certain moment of his interview with Billie Eilish on Netflix's My Next Guest Needs No Introduction.</p><p>Looking back at the interview all these years later, fans had massive support for Taylor Swift, and the same held true for her chemistry alongside David Letterman.

One fan on YouTube makes a strong point, stating that Swift goes above and beyond, like learning Japanese for her fans, just so those in attendance can feel important.</p><p>A fan wrote, "She learned the phrases to make her audience feel important.

He compared Taylor Swift to Mother Teresa.</p><p>He said a decade ago, "Any time I talk to anyone or any time I do an interview, I'm like, 'You don't understand. You have to go there now. You have to go to New York. Just drop what you're doing, and go there. It's amazing. It's the greatest place ever.' "And I guess the city picked up on that," Taylor continued jokingly. "She's the most enthusiastic, obnoxious person to ever love New York. She loves it with like 18 exclamation points afterward, underlined."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-2-1.jpg><p>Today, that support continues, <a href=#>Letterman was praised for a rant on Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's relationship</a>. Letterman told fans to quiet down, and that Swift was nothing but a positive for the NFL.</p><p>“It’s good for the footballers. It’s good for Taylor Swift and it’s something positive and happy for the world,” he added. “And also politically, Taylor Swift is a huge force, and I think just wants to see people do the right thing. So God bless Taylor Swift and Kelsey Grammer.”</p><p>Of course, he meant Travis Kelce, and not Kelsey Grammer...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1llJbDqrCMpZytrJWnuqK6jKynnpmbnruoecmap5qmlaiybrXNrZyrrpmaxHA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./everything-you-should-know-about-shaun-dooleys-wife-polly-cameron-including-her-net-worth-children-and-wikipedia-facts.html>&#171;&nbsp;Everything You Should Know About Shaun Dooleys Wife Polly Cameron Including her Net Worth, Childr</a>
