There’s no denying that she’s been at the top of her game for years now. And while there have been plenty of actresses that we’ve seen less of in recent years, Nicole is still here. She’s still making knockout films that make money at the box office and win awards. You can’t say that about everyone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, when it comes to Nicole Kidman’s personal life, it’s a whole different story. As a matter of fact, Nicole’s life just hasn't been the same for her ever since she pulled the plug on her marriage to <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a>. That’s because she’s seen less of her two children, Connor and Isabella. Some people will even go as far as saying that she hasn’t seen them at all.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>What Tom Cruise And Nicole Kidman's Adopted Kids Are Doing Today</a></strong></p><p>Whatever the case, there’s no denying that her two children with Tom have made a personal decision not to share their lives with Nicole. We don’t want to point and blame anyone here, as we don’t know the whole truth. But what we do know is that something must have happened for them to be living such separate lives now. Here are 15 reasons why Tom Cruise’s kids won’t ever talk to Nicole Kidman again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-not-a-scientologist><strong>She’s Not A Scientologist</strong></h2><p>First and foremost, <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a>’s children refuse to speak with <a href=#>Nicole Kidman</a> simply because she’s not a Scientologist anymore. After she pulled the plug on her marriage to Tom Cruise, Nicole left the Church of Scientology and hasn't looked back. And while a lot of people have applaud her for her courage, she left something else when she cut ties with the church: her two children Isabella and Connor.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Nicole Kidman's Estranged Daughter Isabella&nbsp;Launches Clothing Line</a></strong></p><p>According to the Sydney Morning Herald, “Leah Remini recalls sharing a ride with Connor and Bella to the airport after the 2006 wedding of Cruise and Katie Holmes. When The King of Queens actress asked the siblings, ‘How's your mom? Do you see her a lot?’, Bella shot back, ‘Not if I have a choice. Our mom is an SP.’” (That’s "suppressive person" in Scientology speak).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-doesn-t-support-tom-cruise-s-views><strong>She Doesn’t Support Tom Cruise’s Views</strong></h2><p>After Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman announced their divorce, their two children Connor and Isabella followed in their father’s footsteps and not their mother’s. And for Nicole, this had to have hurt her big time. After all, no mother wants to be abandoned by their own children. And while we don’t know exactly what went on behind closed doors, we do know this: after their divorce, Nicole stopped supporting Tom’s views. And that might be the reason why her children distanced themselves from her, too.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Most Unsettling Rules Tom Cruise Made His Wives Follow</a></strong></p><p>Here’s what one report from the Sydney Morning Herald says: "In the past, Kidman has said she is a Scientologist but now she seems to have left that behind her: 'I wouldn't classify myself as a Scientologist, but my husband is.' She is, she says, her own woman: 'I am who I am and I don't credit anybody except my parents with helping me.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=it-s-us-vs-them><strong>It’s Us Vs. Them</strong></h2><p>Nicole Kidman has made it no secret that the one thing that hurt her the most after her divorce was not being able to see her children grow up. She was very close with Connor and Isabella up until she pulled the plug on her marriage to Tom Cruise. After their separation, it was an “us versus them” situation. Anyone who wasn’t a part of the Church of Scientology was treated like an outsider.</p><p>Apparently, Nicole was never a fan. One report says “Kidman and Cruise started to drift from Scientology around 1992. By now, Kidman had also been exposed to its teachings on her father's profession. "I was assigned to get her to understand the evils of psychology and psychiatry," says one insider, "and to come to the correct conclusion about her father. It was a dismal disaster."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-has-her-own-family-now><strong>She Has Her Own Family Now</strong></h2><p>Letting go of your children is perhaps the worst pain a mother can endure. A lot of people say that it’s something they would never even want their worst enemy to feel. Yet, that’s what happened when Tom and Nicole divorced. And now that she has her own family with her husband Keith Urban, the distance between her and Connor and Isabella is even wider. As a matter of fact, it’s doubtful that Connor has even met Nicole and Keith’s daughters, or his two stepsisters.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Hollywood Babes Who Make More Money Than Their Boyfriend/Husband</a></strong></p><p>Here’s something else. Nicole doesn’t even mention them in her speeches. “I have two little girls, Sunday and Faith, and my darling Keith, who I ask to help me pursue this artistic path, and they have to sacrifice so much for it,” Kidman said earlier this year when she accepted her award for Outstanding Lead Actress in Big Little Lies.&nbsp;There was no mention of Connor and Isabella.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-no-longer-in-los-angeles><strong>She’s No Longer In Los Angeles</strong></h2><p>Another reason why Nicole isn’t very close to her children is because she doesn’t live in Los Angeles anymore. She’s made it no secret that she prefers to live her life out of the spotlight and that’s why she’s chosen to live in Nashville with Keith and their two daughters instead. The further away from Hollywood, the better Nicole feels about her life. She doesn’t want her children anywhere near the Hollywood lifestyle, either. Instead, she prefers Tennessee.</p><p>“That country-music community is a very warm community,” she said about her life in Nashville with Keith and their two children. “It’s very protective. Keith’s been a part of it for decades now. It’s his home, it’s our home. I was meant to go there. I’m very, very happy to live there.”</p><h2 id=they-ve-never-met-keith-urban><strong>They’ve Never Met Keith Urban</strong></h2><p>Not only is it doubtful that Connor and Isabella have met Nicole’s children, but there is no evidence that they’ve even met Nicole’s husband Keith Urban. What makes this even stranger, is that Keith and Nicole have been married for well over a decade now. That means that Nicole’s children from her marriage to Tom have absolutely no idea who are the people in her new family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Photos Of Hollywood Couples' Most Awkward Moments They Want Deleted Off The Internet</a></strong></p><p>That’s got to be strange, right? Nicole Kidman’s two young daughters have two step siblings that they have never met in their lives before. It’s no wonder that Nicole does everything she can to keep them away from Los Angeles. She doesn’t want them in the same zip code as the Church of Scientology. And we don’t blame her or her choices, for that matter.</p><h2 id=she-doesn-t-communicate-with-tom-cruise><strong>She Doesn’t Communicate With Tom Cruise</strong></h2><p>Everyone knows by now that Tom Cruise doesn’t do a good job of communicating with his ex-wives. Just look at how things have been going between Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise. The two haven’t even set foot in the same room together after their divorce. The same can be said about Nicole Kidman. It’s pretty obvious that once their contracts have ended (sorry, we meant to say "marriage") then Tom wants nothing to do with them. It’s no wonder that they’ve had such a hard time co-parenting with him. That word doesn’t exist in Tom Cruise’s vocabulary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tom Cruise sure does a good job of forgetting the people that were once in his life. Many reports have said that the actor used to be crazily obsessed over his wife Nicole. But the moment they split, it was as if he didn’t even know her.</p><h2 id=she-hasn-t-even-met-suri><strong>She Hasn’t Even Met Suri</strong></h2><p>Here’s something else that a lot of people have noticed: Nicole Kidman has never met Suri Cruise. Suri is Tom’s one and only biological daughter. She is also Connor and Isabella’s stepsister. You’d think there was a connection there but sadly, no. Tom and Nicole’s extended families are not the one big happy family they are supposed to be.</p><p>Of course, Suri Cruise isn’t Nicole Kidman’s daughter. But the two still are connected. You would think that Katie Holmes would have reached out to Katie after her divorce from Tom, but that hasn’t happened either. Sadly, we will never get to see the Tom Cruise Ex-Wives Club in action. Nicole and Katie could write a book with plenty of juicy tidbits in it (and yes, we would be the first ones to buy it). But both have been super, super quiet about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-wants-nothing-to-do-with-scientology><strong>She Wants Nothing To Do With Scientology</strong></h2><p>Nicole Kidman grew up as a Catholic back in her home country of Australia. But the moment she met and married Tom Cruise, she was pressured to leave the Church to join Scientology instead. And let’s just say that it wasn’t a pleasant experience for her.</p><p>Of course, Nicole has been very reluctant to talk about Scientology with the press. But the one thing that she has said is that she didn’t want her children to grow up as Scientologists. Clearly, she did not win that battle. When speaking about her role in the movie Lion, Nicole talked about her feelings as a mother to Connor and Isabella: “Love. Exactly what Sue felt, which is why I wanted to play Sue. The simplicity of that love. The gift of a child. And again, Sue has that absolutely simple, loving feeling... I'm getting into too personal things now. Their own lives, their choices. But their love is profound.'”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-nicole-being-forced-to-keep-quiet><strong>Is Nicole Being Forced To Keep Quiet?</strong></h2><p>Of course, no one knows what actually went on between Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman behind closed doors. All we can do is guess, given the information that has been shared by Tom and Nicole and the media. But if there’s one thing that is pretty clear, it’s that Nicole is very careful about the words she chooses whenever she talks about Tom, their past, or the Church of Scientology. Sometimes she doesn’t say anything at all.</p><p>“My eye is going to a dress here — that’s how interested I am in this. I’ve chosen not to speak publicly about Scientology,” Nicole once said in an awkward interview with The Hollywood Reporter. This speaks volumes if you ask us. “I have two children who are Scientologists — Connor and Isabella — and I utterly respect their beliefs.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=but-she-still-misses-them><strong>But She Still Misses Them</strong></h2><p>Despite all of the heartache that she has gone through, it’s without a doubt that Nicole Kidman deeply, truly and desperately misses Connor and Isabella in her life. And who can blame her? She was their mother until everything came crashing down on her after her divorce from Tom.</p><p>A few years back it was reported that neither Tom nor Nicole were in attendance for their daughter Isabella’s wedding in London. She married an IT tech that she had dated for several years. There were reports that said Tom had paid for the wedding, although those were never confirmed. Nicole did have an emotional reunion with Isabella when she met her son-in-law for the first time back in 2016. It was the first sign that said that their relationship was improving.</p><h2 id=she-has-too-many-regrets><strong>She Has Too Many Regrets</strong></h2><p>Say what you will about Nicole Kidman, but if there’s one thing that she’s honest about, it’s that she has many regrets. Of course, she doesn’t want to be in the situation that she is in right now. But she has no choice. Something is keeping her from her children and honestly, we might never know what that is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Also, we can’t ignore the fact that both Connor and Isabella are adults now. They are making their own choices in life. And clearly, they choose to keep their mother away at a distance. And while the ice is thawing between Nicole and Isabella, that’s not the case between her and Connor. Instead, he continues to remain very close to his father, Tom Cruise. Clearly, we see where the influence is there.</p><h2 id=she-was-forced-to-make-painful-choices><strong>She Was Forced To Make Painful Choices</strong></h2><p>Nicole Kidman never stood a chance after her divorce from Tom Cruise. It was pretty clear from the get go that he was in charge of everything and what direction their children Connor and Isabella would go in. Nicole had no choice but to stand to the side and let it all happen before her very own lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nicole and Tom split in 2001. The actress didn’t waste anytime, as she quickly remarried by tying the knot with Keith Urban in 2005. But it was that time in between that hurt the most. A lot of people believe that Nicole worked so quickly to build her new family because it was so painful for her to let go of her old one. Simply put, Nicole needed something new to focus on.</p><h2 id=she-never-wanted-to-be-a-bad-mom><strong>She Never Wanted To Be A Bad Mom</strong></h2><p>With everything being said, though, Nicole never wanted to be a bad mom. And we have to give her credit where credit is due: she isn’t a bad mom. She’s a very loving, hands-on mom to her two daughters with Keith Urban. Unfortunately, she just wasn’t given the chance to prove herself after she split with Tom.</p><p>Love her or hate her, there’s no denying that Nicole Kidman is a very intelligent woman. She’s well-read and she always knew what she wanted out of life. And if there’s one role that has always remained important to her, it’s her role as a mother. It was never her intentions to let go of Connor and Isabella. She had no say in it, apparently. Tom Cruise, meanwhile, had other plans for his children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-refuses-to-follow-scientology-rules><strong>She Refuses To Follow Scientology Rules</strong></h2><p>The number one reason why Connor and Isabella Cruise are no longer in Nicole Kidman’s life is because she refuses to follow the rules. Simply put, she wants nothing to do with the Church of Scientology. And as a result, the members of the church want nothing to do with her as well.</p><p>Now, we don’t know if Nicole Kidman will ever manage to repair her relationship with Connor and Isabella Cruise, but right now it looks highly unlikely. They want nothing to do with her or her family. Of course, we have our fingers crossed for Nicole and all of her children. Here’s hoping for a better future. Anything can happen at anytime. Someone might end up coming around.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>Confessions From Tom Cruise's Ex-Wives</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmimmZi8rbGMpKCdpZGjerW7zGaaq62ZqLJur8eio52qlaN6s7HLmquip56otaq8jg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./15-times-jen-selter-gave-us-more-than-we-could-handle.html>&#171;&nbsp;15 Times Jen Selter Gave Us More Than We Could Handle</a>
