At some point in time, Charlie Sheen was worth $150 million and was getting $1.8 million per episode of Two and a Half Men. Emilio pivoted towards acting and directing, but made <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his big onscreen comeback with The Mighty Ducks reboot</a>.

His breakout role came in form of the 1984 film Repo Man, in which&nbsp;his performance attracted the attention of some Hollywood heavyweights.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He went on to become a member of the legendary <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Brat Pack"</a>—and has starred in several cult classics. From The Breakfast Club and&nbsp;St. Elmo's Fire, to The Mighty Ducks. The latter even grossed $50 million worldwide at the box office. The Mighty Ducks was also one of Disney's most famous franchises, and it even spawned two sequels.</p><p>Estevez seemingly took a hiatus from acting, but that doesn't mean he gave up Hollywood. He worked behind the scenes and even tried his hand at writing and directing. He wrote, directed, and starred in Men at Work,&nbsp;in which his brother Charlie also starred. Estevez also worked with his father, Martin Sheen on The War at Home,&nbsp;which he also directed.

He reprised the role of coach Gordon Bombay on&nbsp;The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers.&nbsp;The star had previously turned down opportunities to feature in reboots of some of the most iconic productions he's appeared in.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He told EW</a>, "Over the years, there have been a lot of reunions, whether it was through the Anaheim Ducks or various charities. Famously, I have rejected all of those, whether it's a reunion for Breakfast Club or The Outsiders or St. Elmo's Fire or Young Guns, all of them."</p><p>He went on to say, "Fortunately, I've been able to have starred in movies that have stood the test of time and have a long shelf life, so a lot of folks have wanted to see reunions of where are they now. So on one hand, it's a blessing to have been involved in that but on the other hand, it's like, I rarely, if ever, participate. So to come back to a Mighty Ducks reunion with replaying this role was a big step."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Emilio Estevez Doesn't Go By Emilio Sheen</a></span></p><p>Stepping back into the iconic role of Gordon Bombay was no easy feat for Estevez. Navigating the risky slope of attempting to preserve the beloved coach's character while bearing in mind that the reboot is a new offering has to be terrifying.</p><p>"That was something that initially is why I didn't want to go anywhere near it for decades. This new take is risky. You have the responsibility of preserving that character in people's minds. But you also have, if they had made the show without Bombay, would there have been outrage to the point where it would not have worked at all?"</p><h2 id=emilio-isn-t-the-wealthiest-member-of-his-family>Emilio Isn't The Wealthiest Member Of His Family</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Emilio has done exceptionally well for himself, an $18 million net worth isn't chump change. However, he isn't the richest member of his family—that honor goes to his father, Martin Sheen. With The Mighty Ducks reboot, he is guaranteed to increase his net worth, but he is unlikely to match Martin's $60 million net worth.</p><p>At some point in his career, Charlie Sheen was worth more than Martin and Emilio combined. He was earning $1.8 million per episode of Two and a Half Men.&nbsp;He was originally making $800,000 per episode but as the popularity of the show grew, so did his and his salary. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlie is now worth $10 million</a>, owing to a slew of terrible financial decisions and child and spousal support payments.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlie Sheen Used To Be Worth $150 Million...
