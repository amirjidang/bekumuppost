He made a memorable appearance on Friends, and he didn't make much for his time on the show.</p><p>Let's take a look back on the appearance and how things played out with his salary.</p><h2 id=how-much-did-bruce-willis-make-on-39-friends-39>How Much Did Bruce Willis Make On 'Friends'?</h2><p>When looking at the history of successful actors dating back to the 1980s, there aren't many who come close to matching the success that Bruce Willis has found. Moonlighting was a great way to get the ball rolling for Willis, but once he transitioned into making action movies, he became one of the biggest movie stars of all time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As most people are fully aware, the Die Hard franchise is undoubtedly Bruce Willis' calling card, but he has appeared in a ton of other hit movies. Willis has done movies like Look Who's Talking, Hudson Hawk, The Last Boy Scout, Death Becomes Her, Pulp Fiction, The Fifth Element, Armageddon, and The Sixth Sense. That's all before the turn of the millennium, which just goes to show what type of career he has had.</p><p>Willis isn't pulling down this same type of work anymore, but that does little to change the fact that at his peak, few people on the planet were matching his success. We're talking about a guy who made $100 million for a single movie, after all.</p><p>In what came as a surprising move, Willis wound up making an appearance on Friends years back.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bruce Willis Wasn't Making Any Sense During His BBC Interview On 'The One Show'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bruce-willis-was-iconic-in-his-role-on-39-friends-39>Bruce Willis Was Iconic In His Role On 'Friends'</h2><p>Back in the 2000s, people were really surprised to see Bruce Willis appear on Friends, despite the fact that the actor had a successful history on sitcoms. Turns out, he only appeared on the show because he lost a bet to Friends star, Matthew Perry.</p><p>Willis and Perry worked together on the film called The Whole Nine Yards, and they had some great chemistry on screen.</p><p>"Bruce and I just got lucky. We've got good chemistry between us, and I say that - and I'm as straight as they come - but I do have good chemistry with Mr. Bruce Willis," said Perry.</p><p>Willis also talked about what filming with Perry was like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We tried as hard as we could to just be goofy. There were very few rules about what these characters could do, and do to each other, and we just kind of went a little cuckoo," said the actor.</p><p>While they were working together on the film, Perry was sure that the film would become a success, and the duo made a bet that if the film opened at the top of the box office, Willis would appear on Friends. It was a small wager, and it was one that paid off greatly in the long run.</p><p>Lo and behold, Perry won the bet, and Willis made an appearance on the show. Instead of pulling down a massive salary for his stint on Friends, Willis had a small fee and made a surprising move.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bruce Willis Bags Exclusive Category In Razzies Nominations For 8 Bad Performances</a></span></p><h2 id=bruce-willis-donated-his-salary>Bruce Willis Donated His Salary</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, how much did Bruce Willis actually make for his appearance on the iconic show? Well, the truth is that his actual pay might have been low, but he wound up donating it all to charity, making it relatively meaningless.</p><p>Again, people were surprised to see Bruce Willis on the show, and he confirmed that it was all due to a bet.</p><p>"I was on Friends because I lost a bet to Matthew Perry," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said the actor</a>.</p><p>Thankfully, Willis' time on Friends had a huge impact on his career, as he took home an Emmy for his performance. This was something that no one saw coming, and it must have felt great for the actor. It all stemmed from a bet, and it led to him taking home one of the most prestigious prizes in all of entertainment.</p><p>To this day, he remains one of the most popular guest stars in the history of the show, and it was all thanks to Matthew Perry's optimism about their film project.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bruce Willis Fired His Entire Team For Not Appearing In This Film</a></span></p><p>Bruce Willis donated what he made from Friends all those years ago, but the impact it had on his career was priceless at the time.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Has Bruce Willis Lost His Enthusiasm For Acting?
