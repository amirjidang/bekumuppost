This is because the iconic comedian and actors, who starred in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">countless TV shows and incredible films</a>, was just so likable. In everything Robin did, there was an honesty and a sense of positivity. Even in Robin's darker jokes and darker roles, there appeared to be a light that shined through, almost reaching out to every audience member letting them know that things would be okay. He brought joy to our lives in a way that wasn't gimmicky. It was real.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Actor, comedian, and former Late Late Show host Craig Ferguson has a lot of the same traits as Robin. Sure, Craig isn't on the same level of fame that Robin was, but his die-hard fans certainly feel this way and still mourn the fact that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> he stepped away from his utterly unique talk show</a>.</p><p>It was on this talk show that Craig first spent time with Robin. In fact, fans of The Late Late Show believe Robin was his best and most consistent guest. Here's what Craig actually thought of the Mrs. Doubtfire star...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-late-late-show-sparked-a-relationship-between-craig-and-robin>The Late Late Show Sparked A Relationship Between Craig And Robin</h2><p>During<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> an interview on "About Last Night Podcast with Adam Ray"</a>, Craig Ferguson was asked about some of the best interview guests he ever had while hosting The Late Late Show from 2006 - 2014. The topic of what makes a great talk show guest is a topic that many have been vocal about, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including Howard Stern and Jimmy Kimmel</a>; both of whom agree with Craig Ferguson that most late-night talk show conversations are hollow and empty. This is where Craig excelled.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth Behind Craig Ferguson's Gay Robot Skeleton Talk Show Sidekick</a></span></p><p>While<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;Craig actually won a Peabody Award</a> for an in-depth interview he did, most of the conversations he had felt far more relaxed. They weren't staged questions and answers. In fact, Craig would famously tear up his cue cards before each interview. Instead, he wanted to let the audience be a fly on the wall and give them an inside look at two celebrities just paling around. He wanted to keep things authentic and in the moment... And nobody embodied that more than Robin Williams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's clear to say that Robin Williams [was one of your best guests]," Adam Ray said to Craig in 2019. "[He was] so willing to play with you at any moment."</p><p>"Yeah, Robin... I don't know if you are aware of this, but Robin had a pretty quick comedic mind," Craig joked. "It was no real chore [to interview him]."</p><p>It's one thing to have a good report with someone on television, but another thing to actually like them as a human being. So, what did Craig actually think about the masterful Academy Award-winning actor and comedian?</p><p>"I loved Robin. He was any friend and I loved him."</p><p>"That matters when you're out there [interviewing]?" Adam asked.</p><p>"Yes! Of course!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Craig Ferguson Completely Changed His Show For Stephen Fry</a></span></p><p>In<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> an interview with Dispatch-Argus</a>, Craig claimed that he built a friendship with Robin as soon as he came on the show. This was the same thing that happened with him and the late Carrie Fisher. But Robin and Craig became so close that Robin even crashed one of Craig's stand-up shows, dancing suggestively to Britney Spears' 'Oops... I Did It Again".</p><h2 id=the-chemistry-between-robin-and-craig>The Chemistry Between Robin And Craig</h2><p>Because Craig and Robin were legitimate friends in real life, their chemistry on camera was like nothing else. Some of the riffs the two of them would get into on Craig's show are simply unmatched in terms of quality late-night interviews. This is especially true of whenever either one of them would cause the other to burst out laughing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the two would go into lengthy, and sometimes nonsensical, comedic routines while on The Late Late Show, they'd actually talk about things such as addiction. Both Craig and Robin have struggled with addiction and have their own unique perspectives on it. While they'd almost always use comedy when discussing it, there was a true level of honesty between them. They knew each other's struggles and found a way to impart a bit of wisdom about it while entertaining the audience.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Craig Ferguson Defended Britney Spears Against The Wishes Of CBS</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like most celebrities, Craig made some public comments about the tragic and untimely passing of Robin Williams. While he clearly kept his most personal feelings about his friends to himself, his tweet definitely captured the true pain that he felt.</p><p>Instead of giving into any petty feelings of competitiveness, it was clear that Robin and Craig valued each other's comedic gifts and one another as human beings. This is almost certainly what made their&nbsp;talk show conversations so engaging to millions of Late Late Show viewers.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Robin Williams Was Really Like On The Set Of 'Hook'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrCzrcigZJ%2BdopzCtLvNZqmemZyhxm7Ax6isoKCkYrynedGomaKmXay2rbjImqSsZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-is-liza-minelli-illness-after-wheelchair-appearance-update-on-the-legends-health-as-fans-seem-concerned-for-her-264229-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;What Is Liza Minelli Illness After Wheelchair Appearance?
