Bosworth has lived in New York City for the past ten years and has a very different life now than she did ten years ago. She has been through a lot, from breakups to injuries, but spends her time now focusing on wellness. Let's find out what Lo Bosworth is up to these days!</p><h2 id=lo-bosworth-suffered-a-traumatic-brain-injury><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Lo Bosworth Suffered A Traumatic Brain Injury</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an Instagram post in 2021, Bosworth opened up about a traumatic brain injury she suffered two years prior. "I was at a restaurant in lower Manhattan (which shall remain nameless because accidents happen) and while sitting in a banquet had one of the swinging kitchen doors fall off it's hinges and on to my head. I was in the hospital and suffered a moderate to severe concussion for months. I took weeks off work and the road to recovery was long. I remember visiting a friend a few weeks later and feeling totally lost on 3rd avenue and 21st street, not knowing which direction to walk in."</p><h2 id=lo-bosworth-keeps-in-touch-with-lauren-conrad><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Lo Bosworth Keeps In Touch With Lauren Conrad</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a TikTok video posted in the Summer of 2022, Bosworth answered a fan question about whether or not <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she still keeps in touch with her pal, Lauren Conrad</a>. Bosworth stated that "Yep! I've lived on the East Coast for more than 10 years so we don't chat super frequently but definitely still friends." Fans of Laguna Beach were probably very delighted to hear that the two are still friends and manage to keep in touch every so often in between their busy lives and hectic schedules, especially since Conrad is a mother of two young boys.</p><h2 id=lo-bosworth-lives-in-nyc><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Lo Bosworth Lives in NYC</span></h2><p>Lo Bosworth has lived in New York City for over 10 years now.
