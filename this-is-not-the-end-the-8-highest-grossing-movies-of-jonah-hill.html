href=#>Jonah Hill</a>, is a 38-year-old native of Los Angeles, California. While his name may be most associated with movies like the teen comedy Superbad, starring Seth Rogen and Michael Cera, or Get Him to The Greek starring Russel Brand and Sean 'Diddy' Combs; he has way more acting experience up his sleeve. Acting and entertainment tend to run in the Feldstein family, as Jonah's father, Robert Feldstein, works as an entertainment industry accountant, while his sister, Beanie Feldstein, is an actress who has starred in movies and series like American Crime Story, Booksmart,<a href=#> Neighbors</a>, and Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising. For the fans who find his sheepish nature as adorable as they do his foul mouth, here are eight Jonah Hill movies that exceeded expectations.</p><h2 id=how-to-train-your-dragon-2>How To Train Your Dragon 2</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2014, Jonah Hill reprised his role in the family adventure animation film, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How To Train Your Dragon 2</a>, after the first installment was initially released in 2010. Even though the movie franchise's star lead is <a href=#>Jay Baruchel</a>, who reprises as Hiccup in all three installments, Jonah Hill's character is also featured in all three films as Snotlout - a name some may consider fitting for the comedian's persona in the movie. The film's monumental success is in part due to the extraordinary cast of actors and actresses that lent their voices to the projects, consisting of Jay Baruchel, America Ferrera, <a href=#>Gerard Butler</a>, Djimon Hounsou, and Kristen Wigg. As it was well-favored by viewers, the DreamWorks animation film grossed $614.5 million at the box office.</p><h2 id=the-lego-movie>The Lego Movie</h2><p>Did you know that Jonah Hill starred as an action hero? And no, I'm not referring to the ninety-second trailer he did with Sam Worthington the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a> video game. Rather, Hill lent his voice again to another animation film, <a href=#>The Lego Movie</a>, this time produced by Warner Animation Group. The movie is decorated with a company of some of Hollywood's brightest stars, which include Chris Pratt who plays the lead character as Emmet, Will Ferrell who is the evil antagonist with plans to conquer the world, Will Arnett (Batman), Elizabeth Banks (Lucy), Channing Tatum (Superman), <a href=#>Morgan Freeman</a> (Vitruvius), and Jonah Hill who played Green Lantern. The movie ultimately grossed $468 million at the international box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=22-jump-street>22 Jump Street</h2><p>The undercover brothers, Morton Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Greg Jenko (<a href=#>Channing Tatum</a>) were back at it again in 2014 with 22 Jump Street. Two years after their first joint operation as undercover high-school students in 21 Jump Street, their back to fry even bigger fish. However, when they fail miserably to pursue and capture a group of drug dealers working under The Ghost (Peter Strormare), Deputy Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) returns them to the undercover program run by the dreaded Captain Dickson (<a href=#>Ice Cube</a>), located at 22 Jump Street. The duo goes back undercover, this time as college students, to track down the supplier of a synthetic drug called "WHY-PHY." The two drift apart as they find their identities in different college groups - Jenko is embraced by football jocks and Schmidt hangs with the party crowd, eventually having sex with an art student named Maya (Amber Stevens) who turns out to be Captain Dickson's daughter. The action comedy's international box office earning was $331.3 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=21-jump-street>21 Jump Street</h2><p>In 2010, Jonah Hill and <a href=#>Channing Tatum</a> go undercover in the two-part comedy movie series, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">21 Jump Street</a>. The film was created as an adaptation of the police television series that aired on the Fox network between 1988-1991. The film follows the same construct of the TV series, where two previous students from the same high school meet again in the police academy. Because of their youthful features, Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) assigns them their first undercover mission, to retrieve a synthetic drug called HFS at Sagan High School. They make progress when Schmidt befriends a classmate named Molly (Brie Larson), who introduces them to one of the popular HFS dealers, Eric (<a href=#>Dave Franco</a>). As the two find investigate further, all fingers point to the school's physical education teacher, Mr. Walters, as the mastermind behind HFS. The movie grossed $202.8 million at the box office.</p><h2 id=superbad>Superbad</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Superbad</a> became one of the most iconic modern coming-of-age high school party movies of all time after its release in 2007. The film highlights the lives of two high school seniors, Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (<a href=#>Michael Cera</a>). Seth gets invited to a party by his classmate, Jules (Emma Stone). He accepts and offers to buy Emma's favorite bottle of Vodka, which he reveals to his friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who suggests that he can get all three friends fake IDs since they are underage. They have an eventful night on the way to Emma's party, and Fogell gets arrested by Officer Slater (Bill Hader) and Officer Michaels (<a href=#>Seth Rogen</a>). The comedy was packed with hilarious scenes that made for good laughs, grossing a total of $169.9 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jonah Hill Teases Move Into The Fashion World</a></span></p><h2 id=this-is-the-end>This Is The End</h2><p>The next movie on the list is likely to never be rivaled in scope for its blatant depiction of a global disaster of biblical proportions. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is The End</a> is a dark comedy film released in 2013 which surrounds the lives of various Hollywood actors and celebrities who attend a party at <a href=#>James Franco</a>'s mansion. In attendance are some of Hollywood's most elite stars such as Kevin Hart, Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Emma Watson, Rihanna, and Channing Tatum. As the celebs witness people being snatched to heaven, they realize they have been left behind in a hellish world. With limited supplies, the remaining six friends' true characters are tested, and the actors are forced to deal with a real-life crisis. The Apocalyptic comedy grossed $126.5 at the box office, which is great given the content of the movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=get-him-to-the-greek>Get Him To The Greek</h2><p>Jonah Hill stars as Aaron Green in 2010s Get Him To The Greek, a record company talent scout at Pinnacle Records in Los Angeles which isn't performing at its fullest potential. In an attempt to boost the company's ratings, he suggests having rock star Aldous Snow (<a href=#>Russell Brand</a>) perform at the Los Angeles Greek Theatre. Aldous is also a hot mess: his last album single flopped, his girlfriend Jackie Q (Rose Byrne) ends their relationship after a drug relapse, and he lost custody of his son as a result. Instead of going to the show, Aldous takes many detours, which Aaron accompanies him on. The two share many honest moments, and eventually, Aldous gets restores his music career and remains sober. Also starring in the film was <a href=#>Sean 'P.Diddy' Combs</a>, who plays the role of Sergio Roma, Aaron's boss. On a budget of $40 million, the movie earned $92.9 million at the box office.</p><h2 id=war-dogs>War Dogs</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who said the road to the American Dream had to be full of Yellow Bricks? For Efraim Divoreli (Jonah Hill) and David Packouz (<a href=#>Miles Teller</a>), they carved it out of ammunition. The 2015 dark comedy, War Dogs, shows the life of David Packouz, a young massage therapist living in Miami, Florida with his girlfriend, Iz (Ana De Armas). After spending his life savings on a failed business attempt at selling high-quality bedsheets to retirement homes, David reconnects with Efraim, who is now the head of his own company which sells guns to the US Government for the war in Iraq. The two enter into a partnership and money begins to roll in. But due to the nature of their service, their business ventures connect them to dangerous characters. Other actors in the movie include <a href=#>Bradley Cooper</a> and Kevin Pollak. Though the film wasn't completely low-budget, it still managed to gross $86.2 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Jonah Hill Is Officially Hollywood's Most Foul-Mouthed Actor</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast Company</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Den Of Geek</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US Magazine</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Roger Ebert</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbXSZqCsZZ6kwW7Ax55knqaUYsGpsYxxZKGhl52ytMCMoKmoq6Oeu6h5zKitop2jYrynecmopZqgXZ22rbiO</p></div><div id=links><a href=./best-selling-songs-20th-century-sales-and-earnings.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Best-Selling Songs Of the 20th Century: How Much They've Sold And Earned</a>
