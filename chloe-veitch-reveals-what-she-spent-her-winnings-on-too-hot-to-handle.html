rel="noopener noreferrer">Too Hot To Handle,</a> and while she may not have walked away with her prince charming, Chloe still got her hands on a portion of the $75,000 grand prize.</p><p>Fans immediately fell in love with her upbeat and bubbly personality, making her quite the breakout star, and rightfully so. Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she didn't get along with everyone,</a> Chloe's time on the series landed her a spot as fan fav, and the money didn't hurt either, but what did she do with her winnings?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is It Really Like Starring On ‘The Circle’?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-did-chloe-spender-her-winnings-on>What Did Chloe Spender Her Winnings On?</h2><p>When Netflix dropped the very first season of Too Hot To Handle, fans couldn't handle the heat, literally!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chloe Veitch was clearly the breakout star of the series, and whether it was due to her open and honest personality or hilarious catchphrases that include chocolate being better than sex, which we are totally in agreeance with, it was no surprise that she won us all over.</p><p>When it came to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her appearance on The Circle season 2</a>, Chloe was introduced further to American viewers, however, she had no doubt she'd win them over, too. "I don't think England and America ever had a war. So I genuinely believe that I'm gonna win over the hearts of the Americans," and that she did!</p><p>While Chloe placed second on the social media-inspired series, she was a finalist on THTH, taking a piece of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the $75,000 grand prize!</a> Although it was distributed amongst the entire group of hotties, Veitch still managed to walk away somewhat richer than when she arrived.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During an exclusive interview with TheThings, Chloe revealed that she was actually quite smart with her money, having put it into savings! When asked what she did with her winnings and if she splurged on anything special, Chloe had to dig deep.</p><p>"I can’t actually remember what I’ve done with it. What did I do with it? It’s been two years!" she said, however, she's certain she put it into savings. Luckily for Chloe, those savings came in handy this year when she got her hands on her dream car!</p><p>"I recently just bought my dream car, a Range Rover!" she revealed. In addition to a car, Chloe is also investing in a flat, making it clear that she's an "independent woman now!" Veitch told TheThings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Exclusive: Chloe Veitch Reveals Her Most And Least Genuine Alliances On 'The Circle'</a></span></p><h2 id=what-39-s-next-for-chloe-veitch>What's Next For Chloe Veitch?</h2><p>While fans were excited to spot Chloe Veitch return to their screen on The Circle, they are becoming antsy when it comes to what Chloe has in store next!</p><p>As she keeps in touch with her former THTH co-star, Nicole O'Brien, and her The Circle pals, Lee, Savannah, and of course, Mitchell, we could easily be seeing her make more friends during her first trip over to the United States this month!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although she couldn't share too much, Chloe made it clear that she is heading over to American soil to work on a number of projects. "I promise, anyone listening to this, there is something coming, and you’re going to be shell shocked," Chloe told TheThings, later confirming that she is headed to the U.S where she will stay for "a good few days working on a couple of projects," Chloe said.</p><p>Will it be a film? New reality series?
