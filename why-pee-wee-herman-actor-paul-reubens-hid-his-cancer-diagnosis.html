ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Iconic Pee-Wee Herman actor, Paul Reubens, passed away on July 30th, 2023 after a private six-year battle with cancer. The celebrity's unexpected death came as a surprise to many and received significant media coverage. Reubens, an individual who came in and out of the public eye during his nearly five-decade career, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">chose to keep his cancer diagnosis a secret </a>and requested that a message be shared with his fans after his passing.</p><p>In the 1980s and 1990s, Reubens' Pee-Wee Herman was one of the most recognizable characters in American entertainment. From stand-up comedy shows to blockbuster comedy films like Pee-Wee's Big Adventure to children's TV show Pee-Wee's Playhouse, Pee-Wee epitomized the era. Reubens' most famous creation was quirky, weird, but fun.</p><p>Reubens enjoyed the spotlight, which has made his private battle with cancer all the more surprising. There are reasons why Reuben's secret made sense, however.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-paul-reubens-39-and-pee-wee-herman-39-s-legacy>What Is Paul Reubens' And Pee-Wee Herman's Legacy?</h2><p>For individuals who grew up in the 1980s, Pee-Wee Herman was a staple. Reubens created and produced the hit show, Pee-Wee's Playhouse, which entertained millions of children every Saturday morning. In 2007, Time Magazine named it one of the 100 best TV shows ever. The classic show helped launch the careers of individuals such as Laurence Fishburne, Rob Zombie, Natasha Lyonne, and Lynn Marie Stewart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/paul-reubens-at-the-pee-wee-herman-show-on-broadway-after-party.jpg><p>It was 1985's Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Tim Burton's film debut, that really helped Pee-Wee become mainstream, however. The film, which has since gained a cult following, introduced the character to a wider audience and led way to Pee-Wee's Playhouse, which ran from 1986 to 1990 on CBS. Even the house featured in the film <a href=# rel=nofollow>has skyrocketed in value</a> due to the film's popularity. According to Yahoo News, Pee-Wee's bike from the film is displayed at a bike museum in Pittsburgh.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Pee-Wee Herman Star Paul Reubens Passes Away After Keeping Cancer Battle Private</a></span></p><p>Pee-Wee is often fondly remembered by those who grew up with the character, however, Paul Reubens' legacy is not as clear-cut. According to Today, Reubens had multiple run-ins with the law and was caught performing indecent adult behavior in a public setting.</p><p>Understandably, Reuben's illegal actions led to Pee-Wee's Playhouse's cancelation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/paul-reubens-iconic-pee-wee-house-sold-for-15-500-years-ago-but-it-s-value-skyrocketed-since.jpg><p>Reuben's personal controversies <a href=# rel=nofollow>did have an impact on his career</a>. After his behavior was exposed, Reubens struggled to find work opportunities but eventually enjoyed a supporting role in the 2001 film, Blow. After years of hiatus, Reubens brought back the Pee Wee Herman character for The Pee Wee Herman Show on Broadway in 2010 and Pee-Wee's Big Holiday, a Netflix original movie, in 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Paul Reubens Sadly Revealed That Pee-Wee Herman Was Always Healthier Than He Was</a></span></p><p>Reubens' legacy is complicated, and this may have been one of the reasons why he chose to keep his cancer battle private. While Reubens had many fans and was appreciative of their loyalty over the years, he also received a lot of criticism. Additionally, while Reubens enjoyed his fame, he was <a href=# rel=nofollow>far more comfortable as Pee-Wee Herman</a>. The character became his alter ego.</p><h2 id=what-cancer-did-paul-reubens-have>What Cancer Did Paul Reubens Have?</h2><p>According to Wikipedia, Reubens fought both myeloid leukemia and lung cancer. When Reubens passed away, he requested that the following message be shared publicly:</p><p>"Please accept my apology for not going public with what I've been facing the last six years. I have always felt a huge amount of love and respect from my friends, fans, and supporters. I have loved you all so much and enjoyed making art for you."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/paul-reubens-signing-autographs.jpg><p>Reubens' aggressive cancer diagnosis and his approach to battling it most likely was a key factor in his reasoning to keep his battle private. Fighting cancer is physically, mentally, and emotionally draining, and Reubens could have found peace in fighting it privately.</p><p>While Reubens' diagnosis was not publicly shared, he may have told and received support from his family and close friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ee-wee-herman-hijacked-these-late-night-show-interviews-despite-protests-from-the-hosts.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His passing was announced on his social media accounts, with a statement from his estate. Reubens did not have a public funeral. According to Find A Grave, he requested to be cremated and his ashes are interned at Hollywood Forever Cemetery, where he joined celebrities such as Judy Garland, Burt Reynolds, and Mickey Rooney.</p><h2 id=is-the-pee-wee-herman-character-retired>Is The Pee-Wee Herman Character Retired?</h2><p>With Reubens' passing comes also the end for Pee-Wee Herman. The character was very much based on Reubens' quirky and silly personality, and he was the only individual to ever play Pee-Wee. It can be expected that Reubens left specific instructions about Pee-Wee in his will and that he requested that the character retire upon his death. Reubens and Pee-Wee were intertwined.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/paul-reubens-as-pee-wee-herman-riding-his-bike-from-pee-wee-s-big-adventure.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Parade, the last time Reubens <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">performed the Pee-Wee character was on a radio broadcast </a>called the Pee-Wee Herman Radio Hour in 2021. Reubens had long wanted to be a radio DJ and finally got the opportunity to make his wish come true two years before his passing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Laurence Fishburne Took This Unlikely Gig On Pee-Wee's Playhouse As A Favor To Paul Reubens</a></span></p><p>Pee-Wee's last on-screen appearance was in Pee-Wee's Big Holiday, which delighted fans and introduced the character to a new generation. Produced by comedy legend Judd Apatow, the film was years in the planning and was developed to be a comeback for the character. The movie, which was highly anticipated, was released in March 2016 by Netflix.</p><h2 id=what-were-reubens-39-final-appearances-before-his-death>What Were Reubens' Final Appearances Before His Death</h2><p>Paul Reubens' guest appeared on To Tell The Truth and Celebrity Family Feud before his passing.

What attendees were not aware of was that Reubens was already battling cancer and knew his time was limited.</p><p>Before his passing, Reubens lent his voice to multiple projects including Bob's Burgers and The Tom and Jerry Show episodes.
