2000s icons, the <strong><a href=#>Backstreet Boys</a>.&nbsp;</strong>Although they were often pitted against their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest competitor, 'NSYNC</a>, it's clear the boys had nothing to worry about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Formed in Orlando, Florida, the Backstreet Boys brought boy bands back to the mainstream and went on to sell millions of records while selling out the biggest arenas in the world. Even now, the group can still pack a huge venue with fans, leaving many to call for a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">much-needed BSB Vegas residency</a>!</p><p>While Nick Carter always stood as the lead of the group, it appears as if every member of the group has earned their fair share of cash over the years, and at this point, they probably don’t have to work another day ever again. So, which Backstreet Boy has the highest net worth? Let's find out!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Everything We Know About The Backstreet Boys' Wives & Kids</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on August 1st, 2021, by Michael Chaar:</strong>&nbsp;The Backstreet Boys revolutionized the notion of boy bands during their reigns throughout the 90s and 200s. As a group, they are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worth a collective $200 million</a>, however, who comes out as the richest? Well, Brian Littrell and Howie Dorough both tie with a net worth of $45 million, while Kevin Richardson comes in with a smaller fortune of $40 million. As for Nick Carter, his $35 million is sitting tight after a successful solo career, while A.J McLean comes in with $30 million. As the group has gone on to have success as soloists, invest in properties, or start families, one thing the Backstreet Boys stand firm on is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their support for Britney Spears</a>. The boy band made headlines recently after extending their support to Britney as talk surrounding her conservatorship reaches an all-time high.</p><h2 id=brian-and-howie-take-the-lead-with-45-million>Brian And Howie Take The Lead With $45 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the fact that every member of the Backstreet Boys has made a fortune, there is only room at the top for a few. According to&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth, both Brian Littrell and Howie Dorough are worth an estimated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$45 million</a>.</p><p>Keep in mind that both of these men have earned money in endeavors outside of the group itself. Brian, for instance, has sold a decent amount of records as a solo artist, though none of his works have generated the same type of sales as the Backstreet Boys’ biggest records from the 90s and 2000s.</p><p>Howie, meanwhile, has his hands in other pots outside of music. Howie and his brother, John, have been involved in Dorough Brothers Development and Consulting for some time now. Florida Today reports that Dorough even opened up a condo complex in downtown Cocoa Beach for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">roughly $35 million.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Howie would tell the publication, “Anything that’s new and fresh around here, I get excited about. We’re bringing a slice of Miami-South Beach ... I think that’s going to be a hot spot. I think everyone’s going to be looking up going, ‘I want to be up there,” Howie shared.</p><p>This could end up being huge for Dorough, who clearly knows a thing or two about investing. It will be some time before those condos are ready to rock, but once they are, they can end up becoming a hot commodity in an underrated area of Florida.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Pairs Of Celebrities Who Share The Same Birthday</a></span></p><h2 id=kevin-is-in-second-with-40>Kevin Is In Second With $40</h2><p>Brian and Howie may be topping the group with $45 million, but the other guys aren’t too far behind. In fact, Kevin Richardson is sporting an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated $40 million net worth</a>, according to&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Richardson has been with the group for all but one record, having left the group for some time. The news of his return was huge, and fans were ready to see all 5 members back on the stage together. Since his return, Richardson has been thriving on stage and in the studio alongside his fellow Backstreet Boys.</p><p>One thing that is worth noting here is that Kevin has taken a look at investing in the past. In fact, there was once a point when Kevin and the rest of the guys considered investing in a hotel, but nothing came from that. According to&nbsp;Chicago Business, Kevin and the rest of the group did invest in Lash Now, but there is no information on how much he made from that endeavor.</p><p>Brian, Howie, and Kevin are the only members of the group that have net worths of $40 million or more, but Nick and A.J. Are both doing quite well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Backstreet Boys Vs.

Are Between $30-35 Million</h2><p>Coming in at fourth place is none other than Nick Carter, who also happens to be the youngest member of the group. Nick was one of the primary vocalists, especially on the earlier records, and he wound up becoming a teen heartthrob once the group became a global sensation.</p><p>Outside of the group’s music, Carter did end up having success as a solo artist. In fact, his first album,&nbsp;Now or Never, was able to achieve a Gold certification by the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RIAA</a>. It was a nice way to kick things off for his solo run, but to date, his first album was his most successful one, earning himself a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$35 million net worth.&nbsp;</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At last, we have reached A.J. McLean, who has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $30 million</a>, according to&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth. A.J. recently competed on&nbsp;Dancing with the Stars, much like Nick Carter had done before him.</p><p>The Backstreet Boys have been making music and performing for huge crowds for years, and once venues open up again, expect them to make bank and take their net worth up a bit.</p><h2 id=backstreet-boys-show-support-for-britney-spears>Backstreet Boys Show Support For Britney Spears</h2><p>As the Backstreet Boys continue to tour and enjoy their fortunes, they remain quite vocal when it comes to the #FreeBritney movement. Considering the boy band and Britney Spears reigned during the same era, the two artists became quite close.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Britney herself has even made her status as a BSB fan clear when she posted a photo alongside A.J Maclean during his visit to her former Vegas residency at Planet Hollywood. Well, with her conservatorship being a hot topic at the moment, both Nick Carter and A.J McLean <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke out in support</a> of their friend, Britney.</p><p>During a visit to Sirius XM's Andy Cohen Live! A.J said,&nbsp;“I could tell you right now that my thoughts and my prayers are with her. I am a 100-per-cent Team Britney,” McLean said. “I think it’s insane. I think it’s, it is completely brutal," McLean</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Truth About Nick Carter's Life Before The Backstreet Boys</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaGTnXqjrcKkqq2qlZrBbq7OsmShmaNiwamxjKGgoKCVqMFuusStZLCnoqm1bsDOnZiyZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./why-ashton-kutcher-wasnt-pleased-with-the-announcement-of-laura-prepons-engagement.html>&#171;&nbsp;Why Ashton Kutcher Wasn't Pleased With The Announcement Of Laura Prepon's Engagement</a>
