The actress rarely posts on social media and, when she does, she’s very selective of what she shares with the fans. It’s no wonder that her engagement to Ben Foster was a huge shock to everyone, her That 70s Show co-stars included. In fact, <strong><a href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a></strong> opened up about how upset he was upon hearing the news of Prepon’s engagement.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Laura Prepon And Joseph Gordon-Levitt Completely Disagreed When Comparing Topher Grace's Intimate Side On That '70s Show</a></span></p><h2 id=laura-prepon-once-dated-the-brother-of-one-of-her-that-70s-show-co-stars>Laura Prepon Once Dated The Brother Of One Of Her That 70s Show Co-Stars</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/that-70s-show-cast.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During her time on That 70s Show, <a href=#>Laura Prepon was rumored to be dating Topher Grace</a>, although both actors have explained on more than one occasion that this was completely fake and were only good friends. However, she did date an actor who made a guest appearance on the show: Christopher Masterson, who is also the brother of Danny Masterson, who played Hyde on the show.</p><p>Prepon and Masterson dated for eight years, from 1999 to 2007. Given that the two started dating way before Masterson made his first guest appearance on That 70s Show, it’s very likely that the couple first met through Danny Masterson. This also explained why <a href=#>Prepon joined the Church of Scientology</a> around that time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Filming The Final Episode Of That '70s Show Was A Nightmare For Laura Prepon</a></span></p><p>After her break up with Masterson, Prepon later dated actor Scott Michael Foster for several years. However, in 2013, the That 70s Show star revealed they had broken up a while before. In addition to these two actors, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prepon was once rumored to be dating this famous singer</a>!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=laura-prepon-managed-to-keep-her-personal-life-out-of-the-spotlight>Laura Prepon Managed To Keep Her Personal Life Out Of The Spotlight</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar52347779-1.jpg><p>Unlike some of the That 70s Show co-stars, Laura Prepon prefers to keep her personal life out of the spotlight. In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2016 interview for Marie Claire</a>, the actress admitted that her introverted personality has been key in keeping her life private for so many years. “I'm not really a partier, so I don't go out and party. I'm very careful. I like having my privacy,” the Orange Is the New Black star revealed.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Laura Prepon Made A Fortune Per Episode Towards The End Of That '70s Show</a></span></p><p>Prepon also revealed that she’s not a big fan of social media. “If you're in the entertainment industry, you have to tweet, be on Facebook and have Instagram. It's an interesting dynamic that I struggle with all the time, truthfully.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She then added, “I'm not gonna spend my day updating my social media. I want to enjoy and live my life. I want to let people in, I want fans to know what I'm doing, but there's also a lot I keep close to the vest.”So even today, with the actress having several social media accounts, many aspects of her personal life still remain a mystery to fans and the media.</p><h2 id=ashton-kutcher-was-upset-when-he-learned-about-laura-prepon-rsquo-s-engagement-through-the-news>Ashton Kutcher Was Upset When He Learned About Laura Prepon’s Engagement Through the News</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ashton-kutcher.jpg><p>Fans and the media know very little about Prepon’s romantic and family life. But they’re not the only ones. As it turns out, the actress doesn’t do a very good job at keeping in touch with her That 70s Show co-stars and she forgot to tell them she was engaged to her long-term boyfriend Ben Foster back in the day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In October 2016, Prepon reunited with her former co-star, Ashton Kutcher, on an episode of Kelly Ripa’s show, Live With Kelly. During the show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kutcher revealed that he was “very upset” he had to learn about Prepon’s engagement </a>to Foster through the news and not from the actress herself.</p><p>"She's my friend and it's weird like that," Kutcher explained. "And by the way, it's not just a random engagement. It's an engagement to another friend of mine, so I'm double upset that neither of them told me." The actor went on to explain that Kutcher, Prepon, and Mila Kunis often hung out with Forster when they worked together in That 70s Show. "I love you, but I am so pissed at you."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In response, Prepon simply said that if anyone should understand the importance of privacy in their personal lives, it should be Kutcher. “I get it,” said Kutcher. “But private life includes friends.” Ultimately, Prepon and Foster got married in 2018. The couple now has two children together, a son and a daughter. After appearing in OITNB, Prepon took a break from acting to spend more time with her family, although she came back to play Donna once again in Netflix's <a href=#>That 90s Show.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdlsCpwM6nZKStpJi1pr6MsJispqRiva2xwKycnWWnnsGpedOhnGaZnqO8trrCnqSepqRivKd5y5qsq5ldpb%2BmvM6nqmadnpyuqLHMnqWtZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./win-butler-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Win Butler Net Worth</a>
