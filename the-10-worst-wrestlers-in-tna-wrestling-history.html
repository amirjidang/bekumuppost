This is one of the main reasons TNA are doing so badly at the moment, and the reason they went through a phase a few years ago, where because they were unable to pay any of their talent due to&nbsp;their vast financial problems.</p><p>TNA even introduced their British Boot Camp in 2014 as a way of bringing more international wrestlers to their Orlando, Florida base and this worked for a while when they signed Rockstar Spud and Marc Andrews. But even this fizzled out, and it also hasn't made up for the bad script writing and equally bad talent they have allowed to walk through their curtains over the past few years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As already stated, unlike WWE, TNA has only been officially established for 14 years which means that there isn't a lot of history to remember when it comes to the worst wrestlers in their company, but the following is a list of 10 of the worst that TNA have allowed on their roster.</p><h2 id=10-crazzy-steve><strong>10. Crazzy Steve</strong></h2><p>Crazzy Steve debuted in TNA in 2014 and given his name, it was already apparent that he was going to be a slightly insane star. But he was completely lacking in all aspects of this character.</p><p>Steve is currently a Tag Team Champion in TNA along with Abyss (as Decay), and it is the first championship he has managed to win in the company in more than two years. Steve has a shocking gimmick and even though it does seem like improvements have been made over the past few months, he is still one of the worst wrestlers on the current roster.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-jenna-morasca><strong>9. Jenna Morasca</strong></h2><p>The former Survivor winner was signed to TNA more than six years after she won the competition, and proved to have been a complete waste of what was reported to have been almost half a million dollars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jenna had just one match whilst she was in TNA and that was against the equally untrained Sharmell at Victory Road. The match was abysmal and it seemed TNA learned their lesson about signing wrestlers who had no wrestling ability, but Dixie Carter has continued to make some random and rushed signing over the past seven years which have attributed to the position that TNA are currently in.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-orlando-jordan><strong>8. Orlando Jordan</strong></h2><p>Orlando Jordan was one of the superstars that TNA decided to sign after his run with their rivals WWE, but he was a big mistake. Orlando didn’t accomplish very much in WWE because he didn’t really have a gimmick and the fans hardly cared about his character.</p><p>TNA hoped they could change this, but they decided to allow him to make his debut with a strange bisexual character that was really awkward and hard to watch. Luckily, he didn’t stay with the company long enough for them to force an even worse character on him - instead he left in 2011 and decided to become a trainer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-jeff-hardy><strong>7. Jeff Hardy</strong></h2><p>Jeff Hardy makes the list for his bad choices more than for his wrestling ability. In WWE, he was one of the shining lights. He had a big fan following and was finally given the WWE Championship in 2009, but following drug issues, he was released from the company.</p><p>TNA then signed him and it seems his drug problems followed him to Orlando as he was in one of the worst matches in TNA History when he was held down by Sting for few minutes into the match. It was made apparent that he was intoxicated from some kind of drugs.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-lacey-von-erich><strong>6. Lacey Von Erich</strong></h2><p>Lacey was brought into TNA to be a part of The Beautiful People and admittedly, she was a beautiful person. She was obviously brought into TNA because of this, which meant that she had no business stepping between the ropes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Coming from a famous wrestling family meant that Lacey was definitely going to attempt to wrestle, but she couldn’t. She was a botch machine and it was cringeworthy watching her matches. TNA put her in an awful situation and it never became any better for her. Lacey was given The Claw as her finisher, as made famous by her family and she even managed to botch that.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-mr-pec-tacular><strong>5. Mr. Pec-tacular</strong></h2><p>Fantastic play on words with this name, but he was basically TNA’s version of Chris Masters. Coming off the back of a decent showing in Big Brother, TNA decided to sign him to a contract and have him debut in spectacular style at a TNA taping. The only issue was, no one knew who he was and he couldn’t actually wrestle.</p><p>TNA did send him back to wrestling school after it was made apparent that he wasn’t going to become any better on his own. When he made his return he was teamed with Robbie E, he began to vastly improve.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-pacman-jones><strong>4. Pacman Jones</strong></h2><p>WWE proved when they signed <a href=#>The Rock</a>, that former NFL players could be successful wrestlers. But when TNA signed Pacman Jones in 2007, they proved that not all footballers can wrestle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pacman was still contracted to The Tennessee Titans when he signed for TNA and they specifically forbid him from actually wrestling, which meant that he couldn’t play a part in any actual matches. So TNA decided to make him a Tag Team Champion when he was unable to defend the titles. Instead, it was Ron Killings that did all the work whilst Jones stood on the ring apron looking silly.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-joker-sting><strong>3. Joker Sting</strong></h2><p>Sting was easily one of the greatest superstars that TNA ever signed. He helped put the company on the map and managed to win an incredible amount of championships during his time there, but when TNA unveiled his Joker character, it became a dark era for The Icon.</p><p>The Joker character was not a great pick for Sting. It was not the kind of natural character that Sting could adopt and it looked awkward and forced. The Crow character was a much better fit for him and played to his strengths much better than when he was The Joker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-garrett-bischoff><strong>2. Garrett Bischoff</strong></h2><p>When your dad takes over one of the biggest wrestling companies in the world, it is a fantastic opportunity to become World Champion, right? Well, that seems to be the way Garrett saw TNA.</p><p>When <a href=#>Eric Bischoff</a> and <a href=#>Hulk Hogan</a> took over the company and Hogan began bringing in the likes of <a href=#>Scott Hall</a> and Sean Waltman, Bischoff decided that it was the perfect time to push his wannabe-wrestler-son to the heights of the company. But sadly, his son didn’t have the desired impact and even a run with Aces and Eights didn’t help his career. So it was no surprise that when Eric left the company, Garrett followed closely behind.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-ric-flair><strong>1. Ric Flair</strong></h2><p>One of the greatest WWE wrestlers of all time, the 16-time World Champion should have stayed out of the wrestling ring after his emotional farewell match with <a href=#>Shawn Michaels</a>, but instead, he made the switch to TNA and it became one of the worst mistakes he ever made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Flair proved that he should never have wrestled again following his WrestleMania 25 match, by becoming a character that even he himself wasn’t even proud of during his time in TNA. Thankfully, his run didn’t last very long because he decided to head back to WWE.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0e9OhnGZpYGLEsL7SrWSwqpWowa2x0axkoqZdqbuiedarnKysnJ67qHnHoqqtp6KufA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./most-sexiest-women-in-cameroon.html>&#171;&nbsp;Top 10 Most Beautiful Cameroonian Celebrities 2011</a>
