She posted song lyrics from the Taylor Swift song "Lover" in the Instagram post. This was relatable since it proves that Brown is a Swift fan just like everyone else. It's clear that the couple has something special and that they are really happy to be in such a good place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/millie-bobby-brown-jake-bongivoi.jpg><p>Several <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stranger Things actors were happy that Brown got engaged</a>. It doesn't seem that she got any negative feedback from her castmates at all. This definitely suggests that the cast gets along, which is what fans have always thought.</p><p>E!

Schnapp said, 'If you have a kid I want to be the godfather" and Brown said, "100 per cent you're the godfather to my kids. And the maid of honour to my wedding." Brown added that her now fiance would be happy with that: "He probably would choose you, he probably would.

But it's in the most platonic way."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Millie Bobby Brown's other Stranger Things co-stars don't seem to have commented on her fiance. It's possible that the topic hasn't come up in interviews. There's also the fact that over the past few months, actors haven't been giving interviews because of the SAG-AFTRA strike. Brown's co-stars are big fans of her, though. According to People, David Harbour said on a podcast called That Scene with Dan Patrick in 2021, "Millie and I have always had sort of a special relationship because I knew her when she was so young. I knew her before any of this big fame hit. "I have a real protective feeling for her.

She said, “I think probably drawing the curtains, just because there are only so many moments in life that you get only once. And to have everyone’s opinions and eyes looking at that just feels unnatural to me. So I feel it’s important to keep those things, those small precious moments in life, really close to your chest. I can say that the planning is going — it’s so fun and it’s such an exciting time in my life.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=do-millie-bobby-brown-39-s-family-and-friends-like-her-fiance-jake-bongiovi>Do Millie Bobby Brown's Family And Friends Like Her Fiance Jake Bongiovi?</h2><p>It sounds like everyone in Millie Bobby Brown's life is a big fan of Jake Bongiovi.
