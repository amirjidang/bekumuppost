Fifth Harmony, now consisting of Lauren Jauregui, Dinah Jane Hansen, Normani Kordei, and Ally Brooke only, announced that Camila Cabello had left the group.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“After 4 and a half years of being together, we have been informed via her representatives that Camila has decided to leave Fifth Harmony,” the girls wrote on Twitter.</p><p>“We wish her well. … That being said, we are excited to announce that we will be moving forward with the four of us - Ally Brooke, Normani Kordei, Dinah Jane and Lauren Jauregui for our fans. We are four strong, committed women who will continue with Fifth Harmony as well as our solo endeavors.”</p><p><a href=#>Camilla went on to pursue a solo career</a> while the other girls continued on for another year as a four-piece.

Saying that they were just informed through my representatives that i was ‘leaving the group’ is simply not true.”</p><p>Later in Camila’s statement, she confirmed that she would “continue to root them all on as individuals and as a group.”</p><p>Fifth Harmony hit back at Camila's claims later that day.</p><p>“Over the past several months we have consistently made every effort to sit down and discuss the future of Fifth Harmony with Camila.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We have spent the past year and a half (since her initial solo endeavor) trying to communicate to her and her team all of the reasons why we felt Fifth Harmony deserved at least one more album of her time, given the success of this past year that we’d all worked so hard for,” the group wrote.</p><p>“In mid November we were informed via her manager that Camila was leaving the group. At that time we were informed that December 18th would be her final performance with Fifth Harmony. We were truly hurt. … To watch Camila walk away from this special world we’ve built with you is tough but we will move forward together.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Do Camila Cabello And Shaw Mendes Regret Their Breakup?</a></span></p><p>In August of the following year, as Fifth Harmony promoted their first album as a quartet, they refused to answer questions about Camila on the Bizarre Life podcast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“We want to talk about our new music,” Lauren said. “We don’t want to be shady, man.

I didn’t love it,” Ally said in a May 2021 episode of her podcast The Ally Brooke Show, adding that her experience was “traumatizing” and “there was so much toxicity” behind the scenes.
