The episode was titled 'The Karman Line,' and it introduced a new guest character who sent shockwaves across audiences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Juliette Kimura was a young girl who arrived at New Amsterdam hospital alongside her brother and parents following an injury to the little boy. It is soon established that Juliette was the perpetrator of her brother's injury. The head of the Psych department at the hospital, Dr. Ignatius 'Iggy' Frome (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyler Labine</a>) diagnoses her as a psychopath. The character of Juliette was portrayed by a budding actress by the name Emma Ming Hong.</p><p>In real life, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5), this kind of diagnosis cannot be officially rendered until an individual has attained the age of 18. Nonetheless, young Juliette displayed all the main characteristics that would qualify someone as psychopathic: she was remorseless, deceitful, highly intelligent, superficially charming, and above all, apathetic to other people's rights and feelings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was without a doubt one of the standout cameos of the season - and the series for that matter. So just who is the incredibly talented youngster who brought so much finesse to such a complicated role?</p><h2 id=shielded-her-from-the-trappings-of-celebrity>Shielded Her From The Trappings Of Celebrity</h2><p>The character of Juliette Kimura was written as 11 years old at the time that she first appeared on New Amsterdam. Emma Ming Hong was likely to be just about the same age, although no official records of her birthday have been made public yet; such is the care with which her family - and colleagues - have shielded her from the trappings of celebrity.</p><p>In 2019, Hong was a sixth-grader at The Henry C. Beck Middle School in Camden County, New Jersey. Assuming that COVID-19 disruptions to education didn't impede her progress, she should now be in her final year of middle school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Young-Emma-Ming-Hong.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hong lives in the Cherry Hill town of New Jersey, with her mother Josie Hong - a physical therapist, and her father - a doctor. Despite being determined to give her daughter a normal childhood, Josie is very proud of the start that Emma has made to her acting career. In one of the very rare interviews of the family that exist, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told a local publication</a> how the young girl had wanted to be on TV since she was 3.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Little-Known Facts About The Cast Of 'New Amsterdam'</a></span></p><h2 id=rave-reviews-on-her-talent>Rave Reviews On Her Talent</h2><p>From the moment she apparently pointed at their television set as a toddler and told her parents, "I want to be on there," they knew that the die for her career was already cast. They started allowing her to express her talents singing with their local church choir and performing in community theater groups.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even at this relatively hidden level, Josie and her husband were already getting rave reviews on their daughter's talent. They were encouraged to try and attach her to an agent. Once they did, the floodgates of opportunity opened and Emma finally saw her dream of being on TV come to pass.</p><p>Her first TV gig was in the NBC musical drama, Rise in 2018. She appeared as a character called Bailey in the fourth episode of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what was to be the only season of the show</a>. In the same year, she made a cameo in 'The Magic Rake' episode of CBS' political drama, Madam Secretary. She played Ai Chen, daughter of Ming Chen, a Chinese politician.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cast Of 'New Amsterdam' Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=her-first-taste-of-big-screen-action>Her First Taste Of Big Screen Action</h2><p>In 2019, Hong got her first taste of big screen action when she joined stellar names such as Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James McAvoy in M. Night Shyamalan's Split</a> sequel, Glass. Later that year, she also featured in another film titled Lucky Grandma, which was written by Angela Cheng and Sasie Sealy, who also directed. She played a character called Luna.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Glass-Poster.jpg><p>Hong was back on TV in 2020, when she appeared as Samantha in two episodes of Apple TV+'s romantic comedy-drama, Little Voice. Like her first television series, Little Voice was canceled after one season despite receiving favorable reviews. After she impressed in her original appearance on New Amsterdam, Hong returned to reprise her role in episode six of Season 3 earlier this year.</p><p>At her age, she still can't say what path her future will follow, but she seems certain that acting will be involved. "It started as a hobby and it's escalated into this and I don't regret any of it," she told The Sun Newspapers of New Jersey. "I've always been very animated. It just kind of gives me like an outlet to show the world what I can do."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened To The Kid Who Played Tom Hanks' Son in 'Sleepless in Seattle'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuscymmGalmaO0brTOp55mrJiaeqy1w2auoaddpbmixdJmmGaoo66wqbvPmquhZZ%2Bjeq%2Bx1maYpqukmr%2Blrcxo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-kellyanne-conways-daughter-claudia-conway.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Is Kellyanne Conways Daughter, Claudia Conway?</a>
