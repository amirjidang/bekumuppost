A lot of die-hard fans of the 2005 Fox series found themselves glued to the screen again as the show aired on Netflix.&nbsp;The show revolved around structural engineer Michael Scofield, and his plot to get his wrongfully accused brother, Lincoln Burrows out of death row. The newfound fame of the series created by Paul Scheuring may be attributed to the trend that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spanish drama Money Heist</a> started. And after reliving all glorious five seasons, fans are back at wondering and yes, ultimately hoping that a sixth season would be airing soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=teasing-the-audience>Teasing The Audience</h2><p>A lot of speculations have made the rounds of several online articles when the lead actors have been giving statements about the possibility of another season. The fifth episode aired in 2017 and it seemed that the ending was apparent.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The 15 Best Crime TV Shows Of All Time</a></span></p><p>But much to the delight of many fans, by December 2017, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">English born actor Dominic Purcell</a>, who plays Lincoln Burrows, announced that a sixth season was "in the works". In early 2018, this was followed by an official statement from Fox, saying that the award-winning show's sixth season was in "early development". This was due in part to many fans requesting for yet another season, the network has contacted the show's creator, Paul Scheuring, to revive the series. In some of his Twitter posts, Scheuring has hinted that viewers may expect a plot that reveals more details from the very beginning of the story back in August 2005. He has also confirmed that actor William Fichtner, who plays agent Alexander Mahone, may be joining the rest of the crew when the show airs again, even stating that he has already completed the script for season 6, episode 1.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In his Instagram account, Purcell posted an update by March 2019 saying, "Due to the merger of #fox with #disney the process of creating #prisonbreak 6 has been slow. The authors of the series are ready. The bosses are ready. Wentworth and I are ready. "</p><h2 id=fans-get-their-first-heartbreak>Fans Get Their First Heartbreak</h2><p>However, Prison Break fans the world over were broken-hearted when Fox announced in August 2019, that a revival was "not on the cards".</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Embarrassing Roles Arrow Actors Want You To Forget</a></span></p><p>Further fueling fans' sadness, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">British-born actor Wentworth Miller</a>, who plays main lead Michael Scofield, revealed in his Instagram post that a lot of people have been sending direct messages to confirm the next season. He replied, "Your enthusiasm is appreciated. I have no idea when (or if) there will be a new season. I'm not involved in that conversation. TV shows take time to produce, edit, air and it seems unlikely to me we'll get a season 6 in 2020. I could be wrong. " He was right though, as weeks later, lockdowns were imposed on almost all major cities worldwide.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-light-in-the-tunnel>A Light In The Tunnel</h2><p>Purcell, the Anglo-Australian actor revived fans' hopes once again in an Instagram post last April 13 amid the lockdown, saying, "I get smashed with 'when is #prisonbreak 6 happening.' What I can promise is this. We are all in agreement that is the story is worthy, it will get made."</p><p>As one of the show's producers, Purcell also adds, "Now with the horror of this #virus the calamity of it all drills inside me a new focus a steely resolve with PRISON BREAK 6- I'm very optimistic with #socialdistancing and a fierce adherence to expert opinion on how to beat this catastrophic unprecedented event, we all as one will be victorious." He continued, "corporations such as #netflix are desperate for content. The biggest gift all #artists #athletes etc can give to you the people is entertainment so let's get our f**kn lives back, listen to the experts! I won't comment on pb 6 until it is time. Be safe. Be smart. Be vigilant. Yours truly, Dom. "</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fandom-rules>Fandom Rules</h2><p>A sixth episode may be a good chance at redemption. Currently, the Prison Break series has fans that span close to three generations, thanks in part to its involvement with current worldwide phenomenon, Netflix. The last revival on season 5 did not appeal to a lot of critics. In Rotten Tomatoes, it only received a 55% approval rating. But the audience didn't seem to agree on the experts, rating the series at 75%. It looks like the drama that started 13 years ago, still has fans waiting with excitement for the next big plot.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Cool (On Set) Facts About The Walking Dead</a></span></p><h2 id=a-hint-is-all-it-takes>A Hint Is All It Takes</h2><p>Other fans who regularly check updates may also see that actor and screenwriter Wentworth Miller (yes, the Prison Break star is actually a Princeton Graduate, and may even be more brilliant in real life) who plays Scofield, has even posted a link of a revised Season 6 Story Idea he has written on his Scribd account, something he has worked on since 2017 and has recently updated just this April. No further spoilers from this article, though he says Fox didn't approve of it. But it's good to know that even Miller has high hopes for another season, if the big bosses give them the green light.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The final and most current cause of some fandom commotion is courtesy of another well-loved Prison Break star. Sarah Wayne Callies, who played Sara Tancredi, Scofield's love interest in the series, took a break from promoting her recent projects to post an intriguing photo showing a picture of her as Sara Scofield alongside Miller as Michael Scofield cradling their newborn son. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The post dated last May 3 was captioned "Happy Sunday", </a>and as of this writing has already garnered a total of 277,696 likes and a whopping 9, 354 comments, most of which were fans asking if the rumors of a season 6 were true.</p><p>If a seemingly candid photo post with a simple caption can spark all this attention, then what are you waiting for, Netflix?</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Mind-blowing Facts About The Walking Dead That Every Fan Must Know</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWgp7a0u81mmaudkaB6tLHArKanZWZis6q6wKWjsmWYlr2xsc2ipaBlmJq%2Fpr%2BMsJ%2BarF2ssm63zaiuaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jamie-lynn-sigler-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jamie-Lynn Sigler Net Worth How Much is Sigler Worth?</a>
