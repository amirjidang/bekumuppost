Both of them had absolutely stellar careers in their earliest days and yet both of them have almost entirely vanished into obscurity. The truth is that Scarlett Pomers, who is known for her roles in Star Trek: Voyager and as Kyra Hart in the sitcom Reba <a href=#>suffered some major setbacks</a> and made the smart choice to move away from the business altogether. As for every Home Improvement fan's childhood crush, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, he reportedly hated the spotlight the industry thrust upon him. While <a href=#>he continued to grow his net worth</a> after leaving the beloved Tim Allen show, he too stepped away from the business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given both of their experiences in the entertainment business, their similar ages, and the fact they are both absolutely beautiful people, it makes sense that the fans would pair the two together romantically. On the other hand, given the fact that Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Scarlett Pomers have never really been spotted together, it's a bit of mystery why so many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrity dating sites claim</a> the two were once romantically involved. Here's everything we know about whether or not Jonathan and Scarlett dated and if they are actually still seeing one another.</p><h2 id=the-truth-about-jonathan-taylor-thomas-and-scarlett-pomers-dating-rumors>The Truth About Jonathan Taylor Thomas And Scarlett Pomers Dating Rumors</h2><p>Both Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Scarlett Pomers have very blurry romantic histories. Neither one of them has been all that forthcoming about who've they've crushed on, dated, or hooked up with. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to The Affair Post</a>, Scarlett and Jonathan started dating after working a movie together and then started dating shortly after.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This backstory is something that appears to be the consensus among many sites, unfortunately, there's a major flaw in the reporting... Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Scarlett Pomers never did a movie together... or a TV show. In fact, it doesn't appear as though they ever came across each in the business at all. Home Improvement and Reba weren't even on the same network, meaning that they wouldn't have even come face-to-face at networks events such as the up-fronts.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Jonathan Taylor Thomas Has Done Since 'Home Improvement'</a></span></p><p>Of course, that's not to say that they couldn't have run into each other at other events. Nor does it mean that they never shot anything together... They could've been part of a project that never landed on its feet and therefore wouldn't be listed anywhere. But the point is that the reporting appears to be highly flawed so one couldn't claim that they actually dated. The same is true for their alleged "breakup" in 2014. Reports say that Scarlett announced their breakup publicly... But where? It doesn't appear as though such a record exists. Especially given the fact that Scarlett was incredibly private in 2014 due to her battle with anorexia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Reba McEntire's Sitcom Was Canceled</a></span></p><h2 id=jonathan-taylor-thomas-and-scarlett-pomers-have-gone-mia-and-their-relationship-status-is-unknown>Jonathan Taylor Thomas And Scarlett Pomers Have Gone MIA And Their Relationship Status Is Unknown</h2><p>Jonathan Taylor Thomas is currently 40-years-old and Scarlett Pomers is 33-years-old. While their age difference isn't necessarily a make-or-break for their relationship status it adds to the evidence stacking up that the two have never dated. Frankly, we don't even know if they are living in the same state. Scarlett is currently a jewelry designer after having a bit of a career in music (something she mostly does for fun now) and becoming a Kundalini yoga instructor. She could be doing this anywhere, not necessarily in California, where most of the internet believes she currently is. Due to her nature of being completely MIA, there is no way of knowing precisely where she currently is.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Jonathan Taylor Thomas Still Rich?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Page Six, Jonathan Taylor Thomas is still spending a good deal of time in Los Angeles. In 2021, he was photographed for the first time in 8 years walking his dogs near Hollywood. However, that doesn't necessarily mean he actually lives there. Given how present the paparazzi are in the city, it's shocking that they haven't caught sight of him for SUCH a long time.</p><p>There's absolutely no way of knowing Scarlett's relationship status as she has purposefully fallen off the face of the earth. She has no social media. No access to the media and, above all, is intensely private about her personal life after her very public battle with her disease. If she is dating anyone then she is keeping it silent. Even her Reba co-star Mitch Holleman, <a href=#>who also vanished from Hollywood</a>, has been open about his current relationship status.</p><p>The same is true for Jonathan Taylor Thomas. His dating history has always been a complete mystery, which just intrigues fans even more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In short, there really doesn't seem to be any evidence to suggest that Jonathan and Scarlett were ever a thing and the origin of the rumors is totally unknown. Until they both decide to be more transparent about their past and current relationship status, fans will likely never know the truth.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Is 'Home Improvement' Star Jonathan Taylor Thomas Still Single?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKaRqbWiuoytmLKkn6d6tbTOppisZaOYrrO4xK2rZqiforKzv4ydmK2hnpx6s8HMqKmsZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./did-marla-my-600-lb-life-died-marla-mccants-still-alive-now-surgery-update-181433-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Did Marla My 600-lb Life Died?
