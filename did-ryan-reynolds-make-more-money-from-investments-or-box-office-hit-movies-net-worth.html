In April 2023, Bloomberg reported that his latest investment is in Nuvei, a fintech business in Canada. The actor's official statement reads, “Nuvei is impressive. The leadership team is exceedingly intelligent and hard-working and it’s about time a Canadian company got the type of attention American tech companies do. I know about as much about fintech as I did about gin or mobile a few years ago.”</p><p>Besides investing in different companies, Reynolds also has a film production company called Maximum Effort. The website has a sense of humor and the homepage reads, "Maximum Effort makes movies, tv series, content, ads, and cocktails for the personal amusement of Hollywood Star Ryan Reynolds. We occasionally release them to the general public." This is further proof that the actor has a good time no matter what he does. And since he doesn't take himself too seriously, he has accumulated a massive fanbase over the course of his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-ryan-reynolds-said-about-investing>What Has Ryan Reynolds Said About Investing?</h2><p>It's amazing to think that Ryan Reynolds seems like a down-to-earth person when fans consider how much money he makes all the time.

But in the past few years, he seems to have found a love of investing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ryan-reynolds-4.jpg><p>In an interview with CNBC, Reynolds shared his approach to investing. He shared that he takes a different approach since he has a background in acting. He explained, “The most successful B2B companies on the planet all have a story to tell. For me, it’s all about that creative. The financial investment side of it, I’m no wizard. The emotional investment side, that’s the part where I get the most fun.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Scarlett Johansson And Ryan Reynolds' Divorce</a></span></p><p>The actor continued to CNBC, “My job is storytelling.

I mean, you know, whether you're talking about the unexpected nature of sports, low-cost wireless, gin, connected TV marketing, ad tech, those kinds of things. You know, the connective tissue between each one of those things is, ironically, storytelling, the same way it is with movies.

He also said that talking about Aviation Gin is enjoyable. He explained, "I love marketing Aviation Gin because the spirits business, there's a little bit of mischief, there, which is, I think, a lot of fun--certainly a lot of fun for me to tell that story."</p><p>In the same interview, Reynolds also talked about how he puts money into brands that he likes. He talked about ordering Negronis while filming Deadpool in Vancouver and learning about Aviation Gin as this was the type of alcohol being used in these cocktails.
