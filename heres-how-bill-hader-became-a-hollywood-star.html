What's the secret to his success? How did he go from struggling comedian to Bona fide superstar? Well, get ready to find out, because we're about to take a deep dive into the life and career of <a href=#>this Hollywood sweetheart</a>. We'll explore the key moments that shaped him into the actor he is today, from his early days at Second City to his current status as a household name.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Glance At George Lopez’s Career In Hollywood</a></span></p><h2 id=bill-hader-s-early-life>Bill Hader’s Early Life&nbsp;</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Get ready to laugh because we're about to dive into the early life and times of the hilarious Bill Hader! Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 7, 1978, Bill was destined to make people laugh with a dad who was a truck driver, <a href=#>occasional stand-up comedian</a>, and all-around funny guy. His mom was a dance teacher, so it's no wonder that Bill has some killer moves. Growing up, he attended Patrick Henry Elementary School, Edison Junior High, and Cascia Hall Preparatory School. Though he had a hard time focusing in class, Bill was always joking around, so it's safe to say that comedy was in his blood.</p><p>With his love for Monty Python, Woody Allen, and Mel Brooks, Bill was a walking encyclopedia of comedy. However, his grades were less than stellar, so instead of going to a top film school, he enrolled at The Art Institute of Phoenix and Scottsdale Community College. From there, he worked as a <a href=#>Christmas tree salesman</a> and a cinema usher. When it comes to his personal life, Bill has been married to writer and director Maggie Carey since 2006, and together they have three daughters. Although they announced their separation in 2017, Bill continues to be an incredible father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-nascent-of-bill-hader-s-career>The Nascent of Bill Hader’s Career</h2><p>Bill Hader's career&nbsp;started in 1999 when&nbsp;he dropped out of college to pursue his dream of becoming a filmmaker. His parents, bless their hearts, were supportive enough to let him use the money they had saved up for his education to fund his life in Los Angeles. Hader quickly found work as a production assistant, grinding away 18-hour days on sets for <a href=#>films like Spider-Man</a> and Collateral Damage.&nbsp;Eventually, he landed a job as a night-time assistant editor, investing his own money into a short film that he was too embarrassed to release.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hader later discovered his true calling; he started attending classes at the Second City with his friends and soon formed his own sketch comedy group called Animals from the Future. They performed at small backyard shows in Van Nuys, and it was at one of these shows that Hader caught the eye of Megan Mullally, of <i>Will & Grace</i> fame. After seeing Hader perform, Mullally recommended him to Lorne Michaels of <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>, and the rest is history. Hader flew to New York to audition for SNL producers and in a stroke of genius, he busted out his best Italian accent, which would later become his iconic character Vinny Vedecci. Just like that, He went from underemployed to a rising star on one of the biggest comedy shows in the world.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here’s How Cole Sprouse Became A Big Name In Hollywood</a></span></p><h2 id=hader-s-break-on-the-big-screen>Hader's Break On The Big Screen</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2005, Bill Hader was hired as a featured player on SNL and made his debut with a bang.

With impressions ranging from Vincent Price to Al Pacino and even Charlie Sheen!</p><p>One of Hader's most iconic characters on SNL was Stefon, the flamboyant New York City correspondent on Weekend Update. Stefon's recommendations for nightclubs involved some of the most bizarre characters you could imagine. The character was originally a one-shot deal, but Hader's portrayal was so beloved that he quickly became a fan favorite. Beyond SNL, Hader had a range of roles in <a href=#>films and TV shows</a>, including Superbad, South Park, and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. With his hard work, he was eventually nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 2012, becoming the first male SNL cast member to receive this honor since Eddie Murphy back in 1984.</p><h2 id=bill-hader-s-peak-in-hollywood>Bill Hader’s Peak In Hollywood</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From 2014 to the present, Bill has been killing it in film and TV.
