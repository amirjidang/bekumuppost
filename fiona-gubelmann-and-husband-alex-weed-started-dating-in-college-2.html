After the audition, she switched majors and began studying acting; this is presumably how she met her partner Alex.</p><p>Weed has made several guest appearances in shows like Criminal Minds, Pretty Little Liars, Gilmore Girls, and House. In Good Doctors, where her fiance is a star actor, he came as a character Chris Santos in Quarantine, where his character was receiving chemo and radiation treatment.</p><figure></figure><p>He needed a bone marrow transplant but didn’t want his dad to give it to him after walking out on the family when he was four.&nbsp;Chris wasn’t waiting for his dad to help him and had made peace with dying, so he decided to sign a DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) form just in case.</p><p>Most recently, Weed was in a few episodes of the fantasy series The Magicians on Syfy.&nbsp;According to IMDB, he will also be in two shorts, Night Journey and Monotony. His more famous other half Gubelmann is currently starring in The Good Doctor season four.</p><p>Even though Fiona and Alex do not have any kids at the moment, they do come off as incredible parents.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-family-enrolled-her-in-dance-classes></span>Her Family Enrolled Her In Dance Classes<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fiona Gubelmann parents Stephen Gubelmann and Victoria Gubelmann enrolled her in dancing classes as a child. The family spent most of their life in Santa Monica California.</p><p>She started dancing and acting in preschool when her mother enrolled her in various classes when she was younger, including acting and dancing. At four, she performed in her first production, a ballet adaptation of The Cabbage Patch Kids.</p><p>Moreover, she spent most of her childhood with her sibling Alex Gubelmann.</p><figure></figure><p>The two sisters are very close and are still seen together on many occasions and on her&nbsp;Instagram, where she shares pictures with her sister, who is now married. Alex is married to Mattew Mcbride, and they are pleased together, and as a sister, Fiona is very happy for them.</p><p>She participated in neighborhood theater as a kid and teenager, attended summer drama camps, and joined the theatre club at Torrey Pines High School in Del Mar, California.</p><figure></figure><p>Gubelmann made her acting debut on television in 2003 on the UPN sitcom&nbsp;The Mullets, and she made a debut in the film industry with the comedy&nbsp;Employee of the Month&nbsp;the following year. Over the years, she made appearances as a guest star in several television shows and movies, making her family proud.</p><p>She also continued acting on stage, making an appearance in La Ronde de Lunch by Peter Lefcourt in Los Angeles in 2009.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=was-she-pregnant-during-fliming-of-good-doctor></span>Was She Pregnant During Fliming Of Good Doctor?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her fans thought she was pregnant during the filming of Good Doctor as she appeared to hide herself wearing oversized clothes.</p><p>Audiences tend to pay closer attention when they see a femme performer dressing a little more sexily or becoming overly obsessed with accessories. That was the situation in the series’ September season opener when she was always seen lugging a sizable medical chart.</p><figure></figure><p>But it looked like it was just a character decision. Once all, Reznick and Park fought for the majority of the episode over who would be assigned a dull case and who would receive the chance after Dr. Lim disclosed residents will be given the opportunity to lead on straightforward surgeries.</p><p>As her character in the series, Morgan has a strong commitment to her career. She is quite competitive, which leads to conflicts with her coworkers. Morgan also has the propensity to intrude on the lives of others.</p><p>She once complained about Claire and Dr. Melendez, for instance. She noticed them going on a jog together and told Dr. Lim about it, alleging that Dr. Melendez was favoring Claire.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ6ZpLuiecaumZ6knZa7r3nAp5tmoKWor6K6w2aYpZ2oYsSmscNmqq2ZoqmypXnDmquippditq95wqijpZ2Xmnpzew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./robert-downey-jr-movies.html>&#171;&nbsp;From Cult Hero To Blockbuster King: The Highest-Grossing Robert Downey Jr. Movies, Ranked</a>
