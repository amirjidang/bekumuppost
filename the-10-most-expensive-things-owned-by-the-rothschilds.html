world, with a collective net worth of over $500 billion. In addition, the Rothschild had over 1,800 real estate properties scattered all over England, France, Germany, and many other European countries, which helped them generate even more wealth and power. The properties alone are worth more than $36 billion. They do, however, own a lot more than that. Curious to see what they are? Read more to find out!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="World's Richest Family: The Trillion-Dollar Rothschild Dynasty" href=#>World's Richest Family: The Trillion-Dollar Rothschild Dynasty</a></span></p><h2 id=gunnersbury-park>Gunnersbury Park</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ever wondered what it would be like to own a park? The Rothschilds have it all covered. Gunnersbury Park was purchased in 1835 by merchant and financier Nathan Mayer Rothschild before he died. With the adjusted inflation, the park is estimated to be worth $3.3 million. The Rothschilds eventually extended their acquisition, buying out the land to the north of the park. The park and gardens were developed further, finally upgrading some features to include a rock garden, an 18th-century temple, a boathouse, and an orangery that had been restored.</p><h2 id=waddesdon-manor>Waddesdon Manor</h2><p>With the adjusted inflation rates, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rothschild's Waddesdon Manor</a> is estimated to be worth $79.4 million. The Manor, now a museum that boasts over 463,000 visitors a year, was originally a country house in the village of Waddesdon in Buckinghamshire, England. The Manor has passed through three generations of the Rothschild family, with each generation expanding their estate to have some of the world's most rare and valuable collections. The Rothschild Foundation, chaired by Jacob Rothschild, acts as its current custodian.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=planet-nine-yacht>Planet Nine Yacht</h2><p>Planet Nine, a name derived from a hypothetical dwarf planet that revolves close to our outer Solar System, is Rothschild's <a href=#>luxurious and ultra expensive exploration yacht</a>. With an estimated price of $102 million, Planet Nine is the most expensive yacht in the world. The yacht has space for over 16 guests, including the crew members. In addition, the lower deck has five guest cabins, with its main deck devoted to the owner's deck. There's also a theatre room with an observatory lounge that offers a panoramic view of the sea.</p><h2 id=chateau-mouton-rothschild>Chateau Mouton Rothschild</h2><p>Chateau Mouton Rothschild, with an estimated over $200 million in real estate, is one of the family's most expensive lands to date. Located in the village of Pauillac in Bordeaux, the Chateau is one of the Medoc region's first wine estates. Originally known as the Chateau Brane-Mouton, Nathaniel de Rothschild renamed the winery in 1853. The Chateau now has vineyards that mainly produce grapes to make Cabernet Sauvignon. However, its 222 acres of land also make grapes grown for Merlot, Cabernet Franc, and Petit Verdot wines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=agora-oil-and-gas>Agora Oil and Gas</h2><p><a href=#>One of the most lucrative investment made</a> by the Rothschild family is the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Agora Oil and Gas company</a>, which is now worth over $1.4 billion. The Rothschilds' investment in the company stems from their interest in the offshore exploration of oil and gas assets in the United Kingdom and the Norwegian North Sea. Lord Rothschild, the current patriarch of the family, reportedly said he was impressed with the company's achievements just two years after it was built. This made them want to become one of the company's founding partners.</p><h2 id=rothschild-s-art-collection>Rothschild's Art Collection</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Rothschild's Art Collection, housed in their Palais Rothschild, has a reported estimate of over $2 billion. The art collection features numerous valuable paintings, statues, furniture, books, and even armor, reflecting the Rothschild family's power in society and immense wealth. Some of the family's images include Frans Hals' Portrait of a Man and the Portrait of a Woman, and the painting Count Philipp Ludwig Wenzel Sinzendorf, made by Hyacinth Rigaud, which was subsequently donated to the Kunsthistorisches Museum in 1999.</p><h2 id=rit-capital-partners>RIT Capital Partners</h2><p>Another investment of the Rothschilds is RIT Capital Partners, <a href=#>one of most prominent investment</a> trusts that are dedicated to quoting securities and special situations. The RIT was initially founded by Jacob Rothschild and aimed to serve the English branch of the family's investments. In November of 1983, under Jacob Rothschild's guidance, the RIT was merged into the Charterhouse Japhet before selling it to the Royal Bank of Scotland in 1985. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is now worth over $7.7 billion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rio-tinto-mining-corporation>Rio Tinto Mining Corporation</h2><p>Wealth and power sometimes can only come from two things: oil and gas reserves or mining corporations. With the Rothschild's definitive list of investments, it's not difficult to imagine that they also have a mining corporation under their tutelage. The Rio Tinto Mining Corporation, the world's second-largest metals and mining corporation, has an estimated value of $103 billion. Founded in 1873, the Rothschilds were able to expand the mining corporation through a long series of mergers and acquisitions. Rio Tinto itself has specialized its operations in refining bauxite and iron ore.</p><h2 id=la-compagnie-financier>La Compagnie Financier</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>La Compagnie Financier, now known as the Edmond de Rothschild Group, which <a href=#>one of the financial institution</a> specializing in private banking and asset management. With an estimated worth of $121 billion, this is one of Rothschild's most significant assets. Based in Geneva, Switzerland, the company is entirely family-owned and independent. It also includes several assets and investments, including the Edmond de Rothschild Foundations and the Edmond de Rothschild Heritage lifestyle brand. It also sponsors the Gitana Team, a professional sailing team.</p><h2 id=glencore-mining-company>Glencore Mining Company</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Rothschild's biggest asset is the Glencore Mining Company, estimated at over $127.5 billion as of 2022. This investment owns several mines in Australia and is currently one of the biggest employers in the country, with over 145,000 employees. Established in 1974, Glencore Mining today also produces and markets more than 60 commodities, with 150 assets under its name and multiple branches in over 35 countries. With a net worth in the billions, this single asset is worth more than Bill Gates himself!</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="The Richest Family In The World: Here's How The Rothschilds Spend Their Billions" href=#>The Richest Family In The World: Here's How The Rothschilds Spend Their Billions</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yacht Bible</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Love To Know</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMamdmpZ%2BowW6x16mcp6uZq7JuwMeipaCrXaTEr7HDZpmyZaSdsm6%2Bzq2frJuYnrmlv44%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-truth-about-rob-schneiders-relationship-with-his-daughter-elle-king.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Truth About Rob Schneider's Relationship With His Daughter Elle King</a>
