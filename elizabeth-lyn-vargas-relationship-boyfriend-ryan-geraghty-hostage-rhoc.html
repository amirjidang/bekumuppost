starring in the <a href=#><strong>Real Housewives</strong> </a>franchise, but nothing could have prepared her for the real-life drama and harrowing moments she faced in her own home. Soon after<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> a frantic 911 call was placed</a>, police attended her residence in Newport Beach and realized the severity of the situation they were confronted with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There was an immediate media frenzy surrounding the case, and it was soon revealed that Elizabeth's life was hanging in the balance, as police rushed to her aid. Vargas' ex-boyfriend, 33-year-old Ryan Geraghty was soon taken into police custody and now faces a number of serious criminal charges. The details surrounding their relationship and the horrifying moments leading up to Geraghty's arrest will shock you.</p><h2 id=elizabeth-lyn-vargas-was-held-at-gunpoint><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Elizabeth Lyn Vargas Was Held At Gunpoint</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the details surrounding this case begin to emerge, local police have released a statement indicating that Elizabeth Lyn Vargas' life was indeed threatened during this ordeal. At 5:45 pm, police attended Vargas' home near East Balboa Boulevard and Medina Way for the purpose of conducting a welfare check but were unable to enter the home for two hours. Upon finally gaining entry into her residence, police located Elizabeth, who was being held at gunpoint by her ex-boyfriend, Ryan Geraghty.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'RHOC': Is Elizabeth Vargas Still The Richest Housewife?</a></span></p><h2 id=ryan-geraghty-barricaded-himself-inside-elizabeth-lyn-vargas-39-home><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Ryan Geraghty Barricaded Himself Inside Elizabeth Lyn Vargas' Home</span></h2><p>There were some very tense moments between police and Ryan Geraghty, as every effort was made to talk him down and convince him to drop his weapon. Police worked to convince him to free Elizabeth Lyn Vargas without injury. Ryan barricaded himself in her home, and a long standoff ensued. He continued to hold Elizabeth hostage at gunpoint, while emergency crews tried desperately to find a solution. Eventually the tense moments were deescalated by authorities, and Elizabeth was set free.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ryan-geraghty-39-s-violent-criminal-history><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ryan Geraghty's Violent Criminal History</span></h2><p>This was not the first time that Ryan Geraghty had a run-in with the law. It has now been revealed that Geraghty has two prior criminal convictions for burglary in the Los Angeles area, one of which is as current as 2016, while the other charge dates back to 2008.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘RHOC’: Elizabeth Vargas Opens Up About Why She Needs Her ‘Cookie Cutter’ OC Life</a></span></p><p>Clearly unable to control his violent tendencies, Ryan continued to demonstrate abusive, destructive behavior during his relationship with Vargas. The day prior to this incident, Ryan fired off a gun in Vargas' home, leaving a bullet hole in her ceiling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ryan-geraghty-39-s-most-recent-trigger><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Ryan Geraghty's Most Recent Trigger</span></h2><p>While there's no way to truly tell what happened in Ryan Geraghty's mind leading up to this incident, it seems he was recently triggered by Elizabeth Lyn Vargas' attempt to take back a BMW she gifted him during the time they were dating. Vargas reports that he had forced her to purchase the BMW, but she recently stopped making the payments on it. The idea of having to give up the vehicle seemingly proved to be too much for Ryan to handle, and his anger was pushed over the edge.</p><h2 id=elizabeth-lyn-vargas-and-ryan-geraghty-39-s-predatory-relationship><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Elizabeth Lyn Vargas And Ryan Geraghty's Predatory Relationship</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The nature of the relationship between Elizabeth Lyn Vargas and Ryan Geraghty is deeply disturbing, and there are obvious signs indicating that this was truly a predatory relationship in every way. Ryan is said to have exhibited abusive behavior in the past and has been obsessed with money and control. He was also known to have difficulties suppressing his anger.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'RHOC': Elizabeth Vargas Calls Braunwyn Windham-Burke's Modern Marriage 'Hypocritical'</a></span></p><h2 id=ryan-geraghty-threatened-to-leak-nude-photos-of-elizabeth-lyn-vargas><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ryan Geraghty Threatened To Leak Nude Photos Of Elizabeth Lyn Vargas</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ryan Geraghty was fixated on money, and he had put his focus and energy on extorting Elizabeth for as much money as he possibly could. He is reported to have threatened to leak nude photos of her if she did not comply with his financial demands. Using fear and threats to intimidate Elizabeth, Ryan succeeded in extorting tens of thousands of dollars from the terrified reality television star.</p><h2 id=domestic-violence-extortion-and-other-charges-have-been-laid><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Domestic Violence, Extortion, And Other Charges Have Been Laid</span></h2><p>At this time<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">, a number of charges have been laid</a> against Geraghty, including, "extortion, assault with a firearm, criminal threats, corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant, possession of a firearm by a felon and grossly negligent discharge of a firearm, all felonies, as well as two misdemeanor counts of possession of cocaine and a Xanax bar."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elizabeth-lyn-vargas-is-shaken-up-and-traumatized><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Elizabeth Lyn Vargas Is Shaken Up And Traumatized</span></h2><p>Understandably, Elizabeth is shaken up and traumatized by recent events. Her life was threatened for several hours, and the brazen threat to her safety was made even worse by the fact that this was all coming from within the walls of her own home. Unable to feel safe in her own residence, Vargas is now on the road to recovery and has thanked the attending officers for rescuing her from what seemed to be an impossible situation that she wasn't sure she would make it out of.</p><h2 id=ryan-geraghty-faces-a-long-jail-sentence><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Ryan Geraghty Faces A Long Jail Sentence</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ryan Geraghty has two priors on his record, and this third strike might be the one that counts him out. Given the fact that uniformed police officers observed him holding Vargas at gunpoint, it's safe to say that this time, Geraghty will be held criminally responsible for his actions. He now has a long list of additional charges piled up against him, and due to the repetitive nature of his crimes, he will likely be facing 75 years to life in prison if he is convicted in this case.</p><h2 id=vargas-has-been-reunited-with-her-husky><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Vargas Has Been Reunited With Her Husky</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the ordeal which unfolded in her home, Vargas was separated from her beloved Husky, and she grew increasingly concerned for her dog's safety. She has since been reunited with her dog and has expressed extreme gratitude for having the Husky safely removed from this volatile situation. Vargas now faces a long road to recovery, and while she works to overcome the abuse she contended with as a result of this abusive relationship, fans are sending support and encouragement to her on social media.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Real Housewives Of Orange County: 5 Best Episodes (& Worst) Ranked By IMDb</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicpaGqlq%2BmwMdmo7KmXauus7PArGSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhdl7y6stGinKecXafGorqMoJyrmZedwbp5x6iqrZmXmnqztM6cZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./abigail-cowen-plastic-surgery-before-and-after-pictures-423984-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Abigail Cowen Plastic Surgery Before And After Pictures</a>
