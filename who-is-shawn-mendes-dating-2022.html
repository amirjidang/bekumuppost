Will he ever stop loving Camila? And what makes fans believe that he could be struggling? A source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a> that Shawn initiated the breakup conversation with Camila in early November. Although Camila was very upset over the split, she agreed it was for the best. The source also added that they were still communicating and wanted to be friends. Some fans think this is why Shawn has been spotted with other girls, but he isn't still in a relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Shawn dropped a very emotional breakup song only two weeks after his split from Camila</a>. Fans figured out that It'll Be Okay was most definitely about his heartbreak. Some people said releasing that song so soon meant that Shawn had clearly not moved on, and he wanted Camila back. He actually fueled the narrative even further on January 13, 2022. Eagle-eyed fans realized that Shawn's latest music video included the matching ring he got with Camila. Does Shawn Mendes not want a new girlfriend? Here are all the details.</p><h2 id=shawn-mendes-has-been-seeing-other-women>Shawn Mendes Has Been Seeing Other Women</h2><p>According to an anonymous submission on celebrity gossip account DeuxMoi, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shawn Mendes is allegedly "excited" about a new lady in his life</a>. The submission starts off by saying, "Was sitting like 2 feet away from Shawn Mendes at Moonshadows in Malibu a few days ago." It eventually continued, "I could definitely eavesdrop a little because my girlfriend and I were close to his table. I heard him saying something about someone named Hollis and heard him say her name a few times." The person who submitted the DM also commented: The name could have been Hollis or Halle because their girlfriend thought they heard Halle. The source wasn't aware of whether or not Shawn's connection to his person was a "known thing," but now fans think that Shawn is possibly seeing someone with any name that begins with "H." The source noted that Shawn seemed really sweet and paid the bill for his small group at the restaurant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Shawn Mendes Is Focusing On His Spirituality Post-Camila Cabello</a></span></p><p>On the other hand, some fans think Shawn is dating a mystery woman named Olivia. While the artist was on vacation, fans seemed to think that Shawn might have met and fallen for a new girl. TikTok user @kerstin.hill noticed that Shawn and Olivia posted similar photos and videos from a beach in Costa Rica where the background looked eerily similar. Olivia is a young woman who lives in Costa Rica and runs a vegan bakery, so it's possible that they could have randomly met while Shawn was there on vacation. Nevertheless, it doesn't seem like Shawn has found the one yet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shawn-mendes-wears-the-matching-ring-he-got-with-camila-cabello-in-his-39-it-39-ll-be-okay-39-music-video>Shawn Mendes Wears The Matching Ring He Got With Camila Cabello In His 'It'll Be Okay' Music Video</h2><p>On January 13, 2022, Shawn dropped the accompanying music video of his song It'll Be Okay that showed him strolling through the night in his hometown of Toronto, Canada. Eagle-eyed fans realized that there was only one tiny detail that proved he was not over the breakup: <a href=#>The music video included the matching ring he got with Camila</a>.</p><p>The music video opens with a close-up of Shawn as the Toronto skyline blurs behind him, and he sings, "Are we gonna make it? Is this gonna hurt?" Then as soon as the singer finishes the line, the camera pans to his hands, where fans see him fidget with two rings on his left middle finger. While Shawn is wearing two rings on the same finger, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the blue sapphire ombré ring is a clear nod to his relationship with Camila</a>. Elliot Gaskin designed that particular ring, and he even took to Instagram to confirm that the ring in the video is the same one he made for Shawn and Camila back in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Shawn Mendes Shares Break-Up Poem About Wanting More Time With Ex-Camila Cabello</a></span></p><h2 id=why-isn-39-t-shawn-mendes-in-a-relationship>Why Isn't Shawn Mendes In A Relationship?</h2><p>Shawn teased a new song on his Instagram page and based on the snippet he shared; it was definitely a breakup song. The first shot he shared showed him sitting in a car listening and nodding to the music while on a FaceTime call. Another image showed the artist in the studio working on the track as he played the guitar. The lyrics were: "Move on / I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans said that he was still not over Camila in the comment section. Surprisingly, his post also got the attention of Camila herself. She commented on the post, "Ur crazy wildcat." That's a line from High School Musical, and more specifically, it's a line that Gabriella told her love interest Troy in the movie. Although it's unclear what she meant, this interaction proved that they were at least on talking terms. Some fans agree that Shawn hasn't been able to move forward because he is still in contact with Camila and still cares about her feelings.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>These Celebrities May Be Trying To Be Shawn Mendes’ Next Girlfriend</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuv8earqdlnZq7pbHSZpuarJmjtG5%2Bj2tpaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./e-l-james-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;E.
