It wasn't anything personal between the pair, they just didn't create a close friendship.</p><p>Jake Gyllenhaal explained to Out Magazine <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how they filmed the groundbreaking movie</a>, "For the first month of shooting we all lived by this river in little trailers ... We all just lived on a campground and would walk to set.

"It was more of a bump-into-each-other casual thing. I was always happy to see you [Gylenhaal], but we didn't really reach out to each other. I kind of felt more bonded to you than I felt that we were friends."</p><p>Since appearing in Love & Other Drugs they have become friends and hang out. "I now have a go-to cooking teacher, which is wonderful," Anne told Entertainment Weekly, admitting she texts Gyllenhaal questions about cooking.</p><p>"The other night, Annie texted me, and she was like, 'How can I make bread crumbs quickly?' I wrote all these instructions, and it took me 15 or 20 minutes. And she goes, 'Oh, yeah, I already thought of that. That doesn’t work,'" the Nightcrawler actor explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-sex-scenes-helped-anne-hathaway-and-jake-gyllenhaal-39-s-friendship>How Sex Scenes Helped Anne Hathaway And Jake Gyllenhaal's Friendship</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/love-and-other-drugs.jpg><p>Five years after making Brokeback Mountain, Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway paired up again for Love & Other Drugs. Adapted from Jamie Reidy’s memoir “Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman,” Love & Other Drugs centers on Gyllenhaal's pharmaceutical sales rep who falls in love with Hathaway's free spirited artist.</p><p>In the romantic drama, the two actors share numerous steamy scenes. The Donnie Darko actor revealed to GQ that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the film's sex scenes helped him and Hathaway form a better relationship</a>. "We talked about what we thought was sexy, about what were the things that interested us, and through the discussion became pretty intimate with each other."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kirsten Dunst Shared This NSFW Detail About Dating Ex Jake Gyllenhaal</a></span></p><p>Gyllenhaal did everything he could to make the filming more comfortable for The Devil Wears Prada actress. Gyllenhaal explained to Hollywood Life how "awkward" it can be to film a sex scene. "I always feel like it's my responsibility to kind of protect and make sure that she [the actress] feels comfortable because they tend to be more objectified."</p><p>So, whilst filming the 2010 movie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he would ask Hathaway questions to make sure she was comfortable</a>. He explained, "So to ease her and make her feel comfortable, I was always like, 'Where do you want me to go? What do you want me to do? What do you feel comfortable doing?' Anne was always like, 'You do your thing and I'll do my thing. I'm fine on my own!'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“We wanted to push it,” Gyllenhaal told the LA Times about the sex scenes. “One of those avenues was when the sheets come off, you don’t cover your breast, you don’t cover a part of your body after you’ve slept with someone you’re falling in love with five or six times.”</p><h2 id=is-a-taylor-swift-song-about-anne-hathaway>Is A Taylor Swift Song About Anne Hathaway?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/when-jake-gyllenhaal-called-himself-lucky-for-having-cinematic-sx-with-anne-hathaway-saying-i-recommend-getting-in-bed-with-her-to-any-man-01.jpg><p>Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal were so close that their friendship became part of a<strong><a href=#> Taylor Swift </a></strong>fan theory.</p><p>Jake and Taylor were infamously involved during the filming of Love & Other Drugs, which is <a href=#>depicted in her song "All Too Well."</a> One line of the song reads, "Not weeping in a party bathroom / Some actress asking me what happened, you / That's what happened, you."
