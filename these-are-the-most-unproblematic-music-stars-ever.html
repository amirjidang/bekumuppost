We've seen a plethora of celebrities come and go and have watched careers crumble right before our eyes because of problematic and intricate behaviors. From addictive and compulsive behavior to bad creative choices, the reasons for one's downfall varies - and oftentimes, it does not always come from a place of their fault.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Versace Fever: Bruno Mars Is The Biggest Versace Fan, Here's Why</a></span></p><p>With that being said, however, there are some musical superstars that are an exception. They do nothing but focus on their craft, making them lovable characters for many and likable stars, as well. They like to stay outside the spotlight except when it comes to their music and always keep their nose clean and away from the trouble, and it's not easy to find someone with those qualities. Here are some of the most unproblematic musical stars from Bruno Mars to Adele.</p><h2 id=bruno-mars><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Bruno Mars</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bruno Mars is a true definition of what a great showman is. He can sing, dance, play instruments, and conquer stages of any size. A "Grammy darling," Mars had won a total of 11 Grammies out of 16 nominations, and he's not stopping any time soon. The only problem that the Silk Sonic half has ever been involved with is his 2010 arrest for cocaine possession, but since then, he's been keeping his nose clean and solely focusing on his music and nothing else.</p><p>"You can't find an interview where I haven't talked about the entertainers who have come before me. The only reason I'm here is because of James Brown, Prince, Michael," Mars said in 2021 about his cultural appropriation accusation. "This music comes from love and if you can't hear that, I don't know what to tell you."</p><h2 id=selena-quintanilla><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Selena Quintanilla</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hailed as the "Queen of Tejano music," Selena Quintanilla was a true icon back in the days. The Tejano <strong><a href=#>Madonna </a></strong>was an eccentric figure who catapulted Tejano music into the popular mainstream, cementing her name among the most influential Latin artists of all time.</p><p>She's another big case of the musical "what ifs", had only her life wasn't cut short at the age of 23 after being murdered by her former fan club president.</p><h2 id=rachel-platten><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Rachel Platten</span></h2><p>You may know Rachel Platten from her 2010s hits "Fight Song" and "Stand By You" from her major-label debut album Wildfire. However, the Newton Centre native's story goes a little deeper than that, as she's supported various charitable cases throughout her career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She donated to Ryan Seacrest Foundation, Los Angeles LGBT Center, and BuildOn, and has permitted her songs to be used in promo campaigns to uplift communities.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Selena Quintanilla Was Really Like To Work With</a></span></p><h2 id=adele><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Adele</span></h2><p>Adele has always been keeping her private life under the down low, at least months leading up to her hotly-anticipated 30 album, in which she discusses her publicly-documented divorce from Simon Konecki.</p><p>Other than that, the Queen of Soul has always been only devoted to her craft and kind to her fans. Her record sales speak for herself, as she's already cemented her name as one of the best-selling musical artists in the world - an impressive achievement at the age of digital streaming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hozier><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Hozier</span></h2><p>Hozier's breakthrough came in 2013 when her most popular hit, "Take Me to Church," conquered charts of several countries. While his career after that song hasn't been as explosive as many people thought would be, he's still a very unproblematic character on and off the stage.</p><p>His sophomore and latest album, Wasteland, Baby!, is a hit in his home country of Ireland and has been certified gold in the US.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Hozier Has Been Up To Over The Past Couple Years</a></span></p><h2 id=jason-mraz><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jason Mraz</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jason Mraz's third studio album, We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things, put his name on the map as it contains his most well-charting hit "I'm Yours" back in the late 2000s. The diamond-certified single was enough to create buzz for his then-forthcoming album, Love Is a Four Letter Word, and make it peak at number two on the Billboard 200 chart.</p><p>Other than his music, he seems to be keeping his private life low-key and is supporting a lot of charitable acts for LGBT people and marginalized communities.</p><h2 id=ed-sheeran><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Ed Sheeran</span></h2><p>Love him or hate him, Ed Sheeran is as unproblematic as one can be.
