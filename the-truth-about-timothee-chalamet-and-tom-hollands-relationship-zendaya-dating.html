Of course, there's the fact that these two handsome young men are two of the biggest names in Hollywood and both are only 25 years old. Oh, and they both are starring in some of the most noteworthy films currently at the box office or just about to be. But the fact that they both are co-starring alongside the beautiful Euphoria actor is what's linking them in the minds of fans. After all, Zendaya fans love to involve her romantically with a number of her co-stars regardless of whether or not something actually happened between them. So, it's only natural that they did this with her and her Dune co-star, Timothée Chalamet... even though <a href=#>Zendaya is absolutely (?) dating her Spider-Man co-star</a>, Tom Holland.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given Zendaya and Tom's connection, as well as Zendaya's incredible on-screen chemistry and friendship with The Call Me By Your Name wonder, fans have naturally pitted the two actors against one another. That, or they are very keen on them becoming BFFs. But these are just potential scenarios for the actors to find themselves in. The reality is much different. Here's the truth about the relationship between the <a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>'s Tom Holland and <a href=#>Dune's potential villain Timothée Chalamet</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-timoth-eacute-e-chalamet-really-feels-about-his-dune-co-star-zendaya>How Timothée Chalamet Really Feels About His Dune Co-Star, Zendaya</h2><p>To truly understand Timothée's feelings about Tom Holland, you have to understand how he feels about Zendaya. There's been a lot of chat about the connection between Timothée and Zendaya as the two go around the world promoting Dune. While Zendaya has a relatively small (yet important) part in the first movie in the upcoming Dune saga, she has been put front and center alongside the film's star. One of the many reasons for this is because the two young actors have undeniable chemistry. They also adore complimenting one another. Given their back-and-forth, it's easy to see why some think the two are flirting.</p><p>But if they are, it appears to be harmless and completely platonic. In fact, they may just be BFFs. After all, they did take a BFF test when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being interviewed by Buzzfeed</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During this BFF test, Timothée was asked who Zendaya's "biggest celebrity crush" is...</p><p>"Easy, Tom Holland," Timothée said as Zendaya laughed even though she has been slightly cagey about what's really going on between her and her Spider-Man co-star. But it seems as though Timothee is well aware that Zendaya is all about her new British boyfriend. In fact, when Zendaya was asked about the truth of her relationship with Tom, Timothée's facial expression gave everything away... Yes, they are totally dating.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Do Fans Wish Lily Rose Depp Was Still Dating Timothee Chalamet?</a></span></p><p>For those wishing that something was going on between Zendaya and the French Dispact star, we're afraid we're out of luck. While <a href=#>he may be one of Zendaya's biggest fans</a>, the two are just friends and only actually met while making Dune. Tom, on the other hand, goes back further with Zendaya which appears to be one of the reasons they two gravitated toward one another so much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Timothee Chalamet And Larry David Formed An Unlikely Friendship</a></span></p><h2 id=how-timoth-eacute-e-chalamet-and-tom-holland-really-feel-about-one-another>How Timothée Chalamet and Tom Holland Really Feel About One Another</h2><p>Well, first of all, Timothée claims to have been mistaken for Tom on a number of occasions. While the two may not look identical, they do share some physical traits. They also have similar energies and a pension for charisma. But this mistaken identity doesn't insult Timothée.</p><p>"I have gotten [called] Tom [Holland], which is awesome though because he's a great guy," Timothée said to the BBC.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Zendaya And Tom Holland Spotted On Another Romantic Date After Confirming Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Zendaya, Timothée stated that he thinks Tom Holland is the perfect person to bring Spider-Man to life. He also said that he's gotten to know Tom through Zendaya a little bit and he's really happy about that. While fans would love to pit Timothée against Tom, it seems as though that he genuinely likes the Spider-Man star. Timothée was even invited to hang with Tom and Zendaya's friends for her latest birthday. This means that Tom doesn't seem to have anything against Timothée.</p><p>While some actors would be threatened by their girlfriend being so close with another star, Tom doesn't seem to have that opinion. Even though he's said practically nothing about Timothée in public, during an interview with Seth Meyers, Tom appeared to praise how cool and suave Timothée is in real life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even still, some fans believe that Timothée is secretly in love with Zendaya and is doing everything he can to cement his position in her life. The fact that he's commented on every one of her Instagram posts appears to be part of their reasoning. But at this stage, it really does seem as though they are friends and Timothée is actually a big fan of her boyfriend. But, only time will tell what's really going on between Zendaya, Timothée, and Tom Holland.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Sony Was 'Dragging Their Feet' On Casting Tom Holland As Spider-Man, Here's Why</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6tbXMqKuhnZVisKmty5qknqxdlruledOopGagn6G5orrDrGSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhdr7KvsMCymGackam2r7OO</p></div><div id=links><a href=./tom-misner-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Tom Misner Net Worth How Much is Tom Misner Worth?</a>
