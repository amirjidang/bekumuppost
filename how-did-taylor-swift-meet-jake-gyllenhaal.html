Their large age gap and the seemingly random pairing (they ran in very different social circles, it was clear) might have been partly to blame, but as always, Taylor wrote some breakup ballads and simply moved on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jake Gyllenhaal Finally Addresses His Ex Taylor Swift’s ‘All Too Well’</a></span></p><p>Swifties didn't let things lie, though, and for years afterward, Jake's sister Maggie Gyllenhaal was repeatedly asked about the red scarf Taylor left behind, and even Jake was nearly speechless after being asked about his personal life one too many times.</p><p>By the time they had broken up, Jake didn't want to talk about Taylor at all—but someone else was fine with chatting about setting the two of them up.</p><h2 id=how-did-taylor-swift-meet-jake-gyllenhaal>How Did Taylor Swift Meet Jake Gyllenhaal?</h2><p>It wasn't Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds who connected Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal, although that would have made for a cute story (and some awkward parties after the split).</p><p>In an interesting twist, Gwyneth Paltrow took credit for setting the two up during a dinner party she had hosted. Paltrow was "reluctant" to admit her hand in the setup, but said that Jake was a "great guy" and that they had known one another for a long time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Jake Gyllenhaal’s Ex-Girlfriends And Their Massive Net Worths</a></span></p><p>As for the Taylor connection, Gwyneth explained that her then-husband Chris Martin "has a friendship with Taylor." No word on whether Taylor's budding friendship with Gwyneth survived the conscious uncoupling from Chris, but after the way she and Jake publicly ended, perhaps she steered clear.</p><p>Either way, the introduction was a hit, though Paltrow didn't say exactly when that fateful dinner party was. Afterward, around October, Jake began accompanying Taylor out, like to her Saturday Night Live taping that year.</p><h2 id=did-blake-and-ryan-set-taylor-up>Did Blake And Ryan Set Taylor Up?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ryan-reynolds-and-jake-gyllenhaal-on-a-coffee-run.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By now it's clear that Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds had no hand in connecting Jake Gyllenhaal and Taylor Swift. But that doesn't mean they're averse to playing matchmaker for their friends.</p><p>It turns out that the couple is apparently close with Jake, and in 2018, a "source" told the National Enquirer that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gyllenhaal had asked for a helping hand finding a girlfriend</a>.</p><p>The source didn't specify whether Jake had any requirements for his future leading lady, but they confirmed that Ryan was happy to set Jake up on some dates. Given that it sounded as if Jake asked Ryan for help, it's unclear how close Blake might be with the actor.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Taylor Swift's Friendship With Blake Lively And Ryan Reynolds</a></span></p><p>Fans might assume that since Jake apparently broke Taylor's heart, Blake wouldn't be too eager to help him find someone else, even all those years later.

Before Taylor, Jake reportedly dated Kirsten Dunst (those two were introduced by Maggie Gyllenhaal), Natalie Portman, and Reese Witherspoon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After splitting from Taylor, Jake seemed to wait a few months before stepping out with actress Jessica Lowndes. He also saw Minka Kelly for a bit. Then, when 'All Too Well' came out in October 2012, Jake seemed to be dating a mystery brunette who wasn't famous enough to have her name dropped.</p><p>Jake then dated a swimsuit model (Alyssa Miller), who publicly admitted to their relationship and "gushed" about the actor (and his cooking skills). Jake's last reported leading lady is a French model named Jeanne Cadieu.</p><p>The two were first connected in 2018 when Jeanne was 22 and Jake was 38. For reference, their age gap is larger than Taylor and Jake's—16 versus nine years. While every publication that reports on the relationship seems to call Jeanne "mature for her age," Swifties might have some choice thoughts about that after Taylor's 'All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version)' music video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbaledOasKWnomLAuLXFrWSmnZWpequtyp5koLGcobKvtMCao2g%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./dj-quick-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;DJ Quik Net Worth | TheRichest</a>
