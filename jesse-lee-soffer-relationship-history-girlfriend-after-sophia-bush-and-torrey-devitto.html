Sadly, even though Chicago P.D. has been a huge hit, several cast members have said farewell and moved on. Even Soffer's co-star and former girlfriend <a href=#>Sophia Bush quit the show</a> several years ago.</p><p>Viewers have been intrigued by the actor's love life since he has been romantically involved with two of his fellow castmates. <a href=#>Sophia Bush and Jesse Lee Soffer split up</a> in 2015, and a few years later, he began dating Torrey DeVitto. According to Us Weekly, he and DeVitto went their separate ways in 2018 after an eight-month romance.

He also starred in the brief TV series The Mob Doctor and played Bobby Brady in the '90s movies The Brady Bunch Movie and A Very Brady Sequel. Many likely recognize him from his time portraying Bobby.</p><p>As Soffer's career has heated up, so has his love life. Since it has been a few years since his two high-profile romances ended, fans would love to know if the actor has dated anyone since 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jesse-lee-soffer.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on how little information there is about Soffer's love life, the answer seems to be no. However, it's possible that he has been in a very private relationship this whole time and he hasn't said anything about it. It's also possible that he has had a few romances or even a handful of dates. Fans can only speculate as he hasn't confirmed any new relationships.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hilarie-burton-bethany-joy-lenz-and-sophia-bush-on-one-tree-hill.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Sophia Bush Confessed The Real Downside To Working On One Tree Hill (And Why Chad Michael Murray Was Part It)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Sophia Bush remembers all the bad that came along with the good of starring on One Tree Hill.</span><p>Some Chicago P.D. fans have wondered if Tracy Spiridakos and Jesse Lee Soffer are in a relationship. Since he has dated two castmates before, it makes sense that people would think this way.</p><p>In 2021, someone posted in the FauxMoi SubReddit and shared an e-mail that DeuxMoi had received: "Two actors from a cop show are dating for a while but apparently are keeping low key..."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One fan wrote, "Only cop show I can think of is Chicago PD, but I think all those people are in relationships except Jesse lee Soffer and maybe Tracey. They have terrible chemistry on the show though, so don’t think it’s them." A few fans disagreed with this statement and replied that they thought that sparks flew between the actors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chicago-pd-jesse-lee-soffer-tracy-spiridakos.jpg><p>Another fan replied that they wondered if the cast members were seeing each other: "Chicago PD? Jesse Lee Soffer and Tracy Spiridakos? He dated Sophia Bush when she was on." A fan responded, "Tracy has been broken up with the guy you’re probably referring to since early 2019."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Chicago P.D. fans thought that it was possible that the cast members dated each other, there has been no proof that this ever happened. The actors never confirmed a relationship or said that they even went on one date. While they always say nice things about one another, they seem to have a strictly platonic connection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jesse-lee-soffer-1.jpg><p>When the actor quit Chicago P.D., <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracy Spiridakos talked about Jesse Lee Soffer</a> on social media. She sounded sad to see him go and it seemed clear that the two had a good professional relationship that was definitely friendly and warm.</p><p>According to TV Line, she shared in the caption of an Instagram post, “Jesse, what can I say, you’re the absolute best. Thank you for your kindness, your guidance and your friendship. You’re the greatest on-screen husband a girl could ask for. I’ll miss being on set with you every day. I can’t wait to see what the world has in store for you next. #upsteadforever.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Brian-Tee-as-Dr-Ethan-Choi-in-Chicago-Med-via-NBC.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Why Is Brian Tee Leaving Chicago Med After Eight Seasons?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Brian Tee recently announced that he was leaving Chicago Med after being a regular cast member for eight seasons.</span><p>Fans also aren't likely to pick up any clues from the actor's Instagram account. He mostly shares news about his career. In the summer of 2023, he posted photos from his time on the picket line during the WGA/SAG-AFTRA strike. If he has been dating someone, he hasn't shared any pictures of them.</p><h2 id=what-has-jesse-lee-soffer-said-about-his-dating-life>What Has Jesse Lee Soffer Said About His Dating Life?</h2><p>Jesse Lee Soffer hasn't mentioned being in a relationship since he and Torrey DeVitto broke up. While he shared with Us Weekly that he was really content during his romance with DeVitto, he doesn't seem to talk about his love life very much.</p><p>However, the actor will discuss dating in more general terms. In 2023, Soffer was interviewed by Variety and participated in a game called "This or that?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jesse-lee-soffer-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked to choose between sharing a "thirst trap" on social media or "slide into the DMs," he said, "I don't think I've ever slid in the DMs." He also said of texting or phoning someone, "Call. Texting is like... I hate it—I hate it." He also shared that he's a "total homebody" and his pals tease him because of it. It was endearing to hear this and further proof of why Chicago P.D. fans enjoy following along with Soffer's career.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/danielle-ruhl-nick-thompson-love-is-blind.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Danielle Ruhl Date Anyone After Divorcing Love Is Blind Season 2 Cast Member Nick Thompson?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Love Is Blind season 2 star Danielle Ruhl has opened up a lot about her divorce from Nick Thompson and fans wonder if she has found love again.</span><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jesse Lee Soffer also played "this or that?"</a> during a 2016 interview with New Theory Magazine.

He might not be that comfortable discussing his personal life, at least not right now. Perhaps if the actor does enter a new relationship, he will wait until things are official before discussing it publicly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqujmnqtscRmqqielpq%2Fbr7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2afoqukpL%2B6ecaiqaWeop6yr7CMmp2tnaJiwLC8x6KYZpqlqLVurc2dZK2noqeyunnDnq2irKSkfA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./did-vice-ganda-and-terrence-romeo-dated-relationship-timeline.html>&#171;&nbsp;Did Vice Ganda And Terrence Romeo Dated?
