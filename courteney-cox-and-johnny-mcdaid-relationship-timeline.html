However, their engagement 'was on a break' when the couple parted ways for a good six months. They got back after this relatively brief break and now are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">madly in love with each other</a>.

David was also quick to find love with someone new. Cox started dating Johnny McDaid, a member of the popular band,&nbsp;Snow Patrol. She and Johnny&nbsp;decided to get engaged in 2014. However, they parted ways soon after, choosing to go in different directions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-they-part-ways><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Why Did They Part Ways?</span></h2><p>Courteney and David stated that the main reason behind their separation was a desperate need to understand themselves better.

The couple stayed away from each other for months - John moved to England and she stayed in Malibu. They reunited in 2016.</p><h2 id=opposites-attract><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Opposites Attract</span></h2><p>Opposites attract and this is precisely what happened with Courteney and John. According to reliable sources, both the celebs have different personalities. Cox has a high-strung nature, in contrast to John, who is more relaxed.

They have vastly different backgrounds and there is a culture clash sometimes. For instance, the American actress mentioned on Jimmy Kimmel LIVE&nbsp;that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John calls her his partner</a>, but she doesn't like calling him her partner. That's because, in Alabama, the term "partner" is used for same-sex relationships.

This is primarily because both of them had the most decent split and wished the best of everything for each other.</p><h2 id=married-before-marriage><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Married Before Marriage</span></h2><p>As one of the most adorable couples of Hollywood, Courteney and Johnny share a beautiful relationship that is definitely going the distance.

Even though the teenager is hugely excited about her mother's wedding, Cox can't do it because, after the wedding, she will have to move to England. David would never let Coco move out of Malibu.
