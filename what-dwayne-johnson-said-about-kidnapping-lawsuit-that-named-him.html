In October 2022, a kidnapping lawsuit was filed, which named <strong>Johnson as one of the defendants</strong>. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$3 billion dollar lawsuit alleged that Johnson</a>, among other defendants, attempted to kidnap former WWE wrestler, Trenesha "Rhaka Khan" Biggers, and her family.</p><p>Since the lawsuit became public in early 2023, Johnson has spoken about the allegations.</p><h2 id=what-has-dwayne-johnson-said-about-the-kidnapping-lawsuit>What Has Dwayne Johnson Said About The Kidnapping Lawsuit?</h2><p>According to Snopes, Biggers' lawsuit against Dwayne Johnson and other defendants did not start to become publicly known until April 2023. Rumors about the lawsuit began to appear on social media platforms such as TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), and Facebook.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/dwayne-johnson-black-adam-photo-call-madrid.jpg><p>According to Biggers' lawsuit filing, Johnson was<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> among multiple major defendants named</a>. Alongside Johnson, rapper Eminem, NBA star Michael Jordan, and major corporations such as Universal Studios and Verizon were listed.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Dwayne Johnson And The Stars Of Amazon Prime Video's Movies And TV Shows Make An Absolute Fortune</a></span></p><p>In her lawsuit, Biggers alleged that Johnson, among others, attempted to kidnap her and her family in 2008. She further alleged that Johnson and Dany Garcia hired individuals to kidnap Biggers and her children from their Tampa, Florida home and bring them to Miami, Florida against their will. Once she was forcefully brought to Miami, Biggers alleged that she was abused and received threats from Johnson, among others, if she refused to comply with their demands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Johnson has released a statement through his attorney team since the lawsuit became public.</strong></p><p>According to the statement, Johnson and Garcia "categorically deny any involvement in the alleged incident" and "look forward to clearing their names in court."</p><h2 id=how-has-the-lawsuit-affected-dwayne-johnson-39-s-life-and-career>How Has The Lawsuit Affected Dwayne Johnson's Life And Career?</h2><p>Dwayne Johnson has enjoyed a lengthy affiliation with The Walt Disney Company, starring in Moana, Jungle Cruise, The Game Plan, as well as additional projects. According to Inside the Magic, Disney has yet to officially break ties with Johnson, despite rumors among fans. In April 2023, Disney announced a live-action remake of Moana, with Johnson set to reprise his role as Maui.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Dwayne Johnson Reportedly Hated WWE's Shawn Michaels Before He Became His Daughter's Boss</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of October 2023, Disney has not officially stated that Johnson is no longer playing Maui in the upcoming Moana live action film, according to Microsoft Start. Inside the Magic reported that Johnson was however allegedly removed from a future Pirates of the Caribbean project.</p><p>Fans of the DC Extended Universe have wondered if Johnson's Black Adam would return in future projects. Johnson addressed the future of Black Adam in December 2022, before the lawsuit was made public. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Johnson had conversations with James Gunn, DC's new creative head, and a Black Adam sequel is not planned in the foreseeable future, however Johnson wrote in an X (formerly Twitter) post that:</p><p>"DC and Seven Bucks have agreed to continue exploring the most valuable ways Black Adam can be utilized in future DC multiverse chapters."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It can be assumed that Black Adam 2's absence from DC's "First Chapter" project schedule is due to creative reasons, rather than Johnson's allegations. Gunn is masterminding a completely new vision for DC films, television shows, and media and Black Adam is not a priority. Furthermore, the first Black Adam film got mixed reviews and was a box office disappointment for Warner Brothers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/dwayne-johnson-black-adam-london-premeire.jpg><p>In June 2023, Johnson posted a video on his social media accounts announcing that he is returning to one of his most iconic franchises, Fast & Furious, according to CNN. In his video, he assured fans that he is "one hundred percent confirming" the return of his character, Luke Hobbs. His announcement delighted fans around the world, after a lengthy absence from the franchise due to alleged beef with Vin Diesel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Diesel and Johnson have reportedly reconciled and are on better terms. After Fast X premiered, Diesel allegedly began to <a href=# rel=nofollow>have a feud with Jason Momoa</a>, claiming that he is responsible for Fast X's disappointing box office performance.</p><p>Johnson is set to star in a Christmas-themed film called Red One, co-starring with Chris Evans of Marvel Cinematic Universe fame. The film, which will be distributed by Amazon MGM Studios, was planned for a 2023 release. The film is completed and is scheduled for a release despite Johnson's lawsuit.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Real Reason Henry Cavill Fired Dwayne Johnson's Ex-Wife, Dany Garcia</a></span></p><p>While not much is known about Johnson's upcoming film schedule, he is still attached to blockbuster projects despite the lawsuit. Johnson <a href=# rel=nofollow>may have lost roles due to the lawsuit</a>, however.

He has only discussed future projects, his tequila brand, and his personal passions with the media since the allegations came forward. Johnson made a public statement regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict in October 2023 on his Instagram account stating:</p><p>"I'm heartbroken, angry, and sickened by the brutal murders and kidnapping of Jewish people through the horrific acts of the Hamas terrorist group...I condemn and denounce terrorism, and in this devastating moment, my heart goes out to all the innocent victims and families grieving for their lost loved ones.

It cannot be confirmed as of November 2023, if Johnson was accurately accused of illegal behavior. Based on Johnson's legal statement, <strong>he fully denies any wrongdoing or involvement with kidnapping Trenesha "Rhaka Khan" Biggers.</strong></p><p>Johnson seemed to be in good spirits for Halloween 2023, dressing up as David Beckham for the holiday.
