"But she credits Ellen DeGeneres as the reason she adopted the Lab mix."</p><p>"How could she refuse," the book adds. '"It's sort of like when Oprah tells you to do something," Meghan said.

The talk show host was even allowed to hold the child, and has spoken about the experience, joking: “He weighs 15 lbs., which is, the exchange rate, is 17 dollars here!”, and also mentioned that he shares dad Harry's famous hair colour.</p><p>Since then, Ellen has reportedly bonded with the couple over environmental issues and joint charitable interests.</p><h2 id=now-they-live-nearby-ellen-frequently-comes-over-to-megan-markle-39-s-house><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Now They Live Nearby, Ellen Frequently Comes Over To Megan Markle's House</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ellen and Meghan now both live in a similar area in California, and as such frequently see each other. Ellen is reportedly a frequent guest at Meghan and Harry's Montecito mansion, frequently 'popping over' to see the couple, and has apparently also met their children, Archie and Lillibet.</p><p>It seems that proximity is making the heart grow fonder for these two, who both enjoy time in the California sun. Ellen's Burbank studio was just a short drive for Meghan to appear on Ellen's show.

Ellen famously told her, ‘Get it.’</p><p>“Since then, they’ve developed a close friendship. We saw Portia and Ellen visit London. They visited Harry and Meghan at their home. … They got to meet Archie for the first time, and they’ve also collaborated on some of their charitable work, too. Harry and Meghan supported Ellen in an elephant conservation initiative that she was involved in, and I think we’ll see them come together with their work as well as their social life much more in the future.”</p><h2 id=it-seems-that-meghan-markle-and-ellen-degeneres-are-definitely-friends-but-its-hard-to-say-how-close><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>It Seems That Meghan Markle And Ellen Degeneres Are Definitely Friends, But Its Hard To Say How Close</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meghan and Ellen certainly appear to be familiar with each other - having met outside of the show on multiple occasions, but we have little proof that they spend much time together.
