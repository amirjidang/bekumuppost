At that time, <strong>Lenny got engaged to his alleged mistress while his divorce was still pending</strong> (it still was, as of April 2024). The matter sparked a conversation online, with even Lenny's mother commenting on the engagement post. "I will be very happy you're getting a woman who loves and respects you. You certainly did not have that in your previous marriage."</p><p>The studio audience were obviously on Lisa's side, just like the co-hosts. It then led to them talking about that "special type of rage" in a divorce, as Behar called it. "As somebody who has been divorced, I want to say there's a special type of rage involved when you get divorced, she claimed.</p><p>"You are murderous, homicidal. A lot of women understand that. There's something about – even if you want the divorce, there's something about that wrenching that makes you homicidal."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Behar received applause for her statement, to which Alyssa Farah agreed. "The problem is it doesn't go away quickly, at least in my experience," she shared, "and you can't let that fester or dwell, or it can take on." But <strong>Whoopi Goldberg was "dancing and prancing around" during her divorce, "so glad to get out of there."</strong> She added: I was never meant to be married, and I know that, and I knew that then. And I kept trying to do what everybody would say I was supposed to do."</p><p>In December 2022, <strong>Behar said divorces are rampant because people live longer these days</strong>. "They say 'till death do us part', that's a long time! I mean, people used to live to 40-ish and then they would die!" she said in a hot take. "And now, you don't die at 40, and so that's why you get a divorce a lot of times and so people live to be a hundred sometimes, I certainly hope I will!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whoopi Goldberg was married three times: Alvin Martin (1973-1979), David Claessen (1986-1988), and Lyle Trachtenberg (1994-1995).</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/your-paragraph-text-2024-06-27t082250-165.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Sunny Hostin Had The Opposite Reaction To Sean Evans On The View Compared To Whoopi And Joy">Sunny Hostin Had The Opposite Reaction To Sean Evans On The View Compared To Whoopi And Joy</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Sunny Hostin embraced Sean Evans' presence and even got a little flirty, while Goldberg and Behar kept their distance.</p><h2 id=joy-behar-quot-wouldn-39-t-have-a-comedy-career-quot-if-she-didn-39-t-divorce-her-first-husband-joe-behar>Joy Behar "Wouldn't Have A Comedy Career" If She Didn't Divorce Her First Husband Joe Behar</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/instar47806804.jpg><p>Reacting to Jodie Turner-Smith and Joshua Jackson's divorce in February 2024, The View hosts commended the pair for having a "successful" split. "<strong>If there's no restraining order involved, I think it's a success</strong>," Sunny Hostin joked. If there's a restraining order, maybe we can say it was a failure. Most marriages end because people grow apart or there’s some chippy on the side. Those are the two reasons."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Behar then said, "I don't think that I'd be sitting here if I stayed married."</p><p>"We had many things that we didn't — he wanted to live at the beach, I hate the beach," she explained. "You have geographical differences, you have taste differences. You're growing in this way and he's growing in that way." She clarified that she wasn't advocating for divorce as "it's very painful" and "the children suffer."</p><p>Behar concluded: "In my own case, <strong>I wouldn't have a comedy career. I don't think I would've had a career in the same way if I stayed married because I was accompanying him in his life</strong>."

They first met at a semi-nudist colony in 1982, just a year after the comedian's divorce from Joe Behar. "I don't know if you know this about me, but I met my husband at a semi-nudist colony. It's true," she said on The View. "He was naked, I was not. Because for a man to see me naked, I have to be in his will." In 2011, Behar told Rachael Ray <strong>she "waited until all the parents were dead" to remarry</strong>.</p><p>"So I have no in-laws at all," she said. "He has none and I have none. 'Cause marriage is mostly about in-laws, I find. They always want you to visit them and come for lasagna."</p><p><strong>The legalization of gay marriage also had an influence on Behar and Janowitz's decision</strong>. "It did have an influence on me. It brought to my consciousness why gays needed to get married," said the TV personality. "And I thought it was a good reason for me to get married ... So did Steve, so we did it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2022, Behar revealed that she only moved in with Janowitz in 2002. "I used to say, 'I want a man in my life but not in my house!'" she recalled. "And so I had that 20 years like that. Then in 2002, he moved in and we got married in 2011, so look at that.<strong> I needed to be single after being married, I loved having my own place</strong>."</p><p>Joy Behar has one child, her TV producer daughter Eve Behar, whom she shares with her first husband, Joe Behar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/04/the-view-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>the view</h5>Talk Show <strong>Release Date</strong> <span>August 11, 1997</span> <strong>Seasons</strong> <span>26</span> <strong>Story By</strong> <span>Barbara Walters</span> <strong>Network</strong> <span>ABC</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqLFdl7KprdFmpK6qlJq%2FsMHSZpuirp%2BnsKZ5wqikpp2eqcBuwMeeZK%2Bhlax8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kathy-whitworth-net-worth-at-death.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kathy Whitworth Net Worth at Death</a>
