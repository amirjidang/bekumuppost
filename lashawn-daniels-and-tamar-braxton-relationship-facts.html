The reality star and famous songwriter were friends for years. Like any friendship, the two had their fair share of ups and downs. At the end of the day, though, they remained the best of buds. When LaShawn passed in the fall of 2019, Tamar Braxton had been devastated. The Tamar & Vince reality star lost her best friend that year. Despite his abrupt passing, she keeps him in her memory. That’s a true friendship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened Between Tamar Braxton And Her First Husband, Darrell “Delite” Allamby?</a></span></p><h2 id=their-friendship-over-the-years>Their Friendship Over The Years</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tamar Braxton and LaShawn Daniels's friendship played a huge role in their musical success in 2012. The Real host worked on a number of tracks with the sought-after songwriter. Daniels even helped boost her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">single “Love and War” to the No. 1 spot</a> on the U.s iTunes chart in 2012. That same year, her album of the same name received two Grammy nominations in the categories Best R&B Performance and for Best R&B Song. Additionally, Daniels helped Braxton write several other songs off the album, such as “Hot Sugar” and “The One.” Additionally, Daniels’ collaborations with Braxton were listed on the album.</p><p>Not to mention, Braxton featured Daniels and his wife April on her series Tamar & Vince for comedic relief. Tamar and her sisters were downright funny, but LaShawn and his wife April had the audience cackling for days. Clearly, Tamar Braxton and LaShawn Daniels had the perfect relationship, they were business partners and even best friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Reason Tamar Braxton Doesn’t Get Along With Her Sisters Anymore</a></span></p><h2 id=they-weren-t-always-perfect>They Weren’t Always Perfect</h2><p>Despite their great friendship, they also went through some rough patches. Even the best of friends can sometimes have fights. It came as a shock to fans when Tamar Braxton <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dissed her best friend and his wife April Daniels</a> during a Feb. 11, 2016 episode of Tamar & Vince. The “Love & War” songstress accused the couple of refusing to visit her in the hospital during a medical crisis back in 2015. Furthermore, Braxton expressed that she then believed her so-called friends only used the show to gain fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though, it doesn’t seem all that likely that LaShawn and his wife needed the “extra leg up” in the business. The songwriter worked with some of the biggest names in Hollywood, such as Lady Gaga, Brandy, Monica, Jennifer Lopez, and even Destiny’s Child. If anything, Daniels was doing just fine without Tamar Braxton’s help.</p><p>In continuation of the Feb. 11 episode, Vince coaxed his wife into expressing her anguish at her friends. Though, talking out her feelings wasn’t enough for the R&B singer. Braxton even took to Instagram that year to post a message about “being stabbed in the back by her friends.” Apparently, the lengthy post contained some harsh words about Daniel and his wife April. However, the songwriter wasn’t took keen on the ill-words said about his wife. Daniels posted a video to social media, immediately shutting down haters and Tamar Braxton. “Don’t talk about my wife, you’re playing yourself,” the songwriter said in the video. Despite their problems, Tamar Braxton and LaShawn Daniels eventually moved past their bitter fight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tamar Braxton Unfollows Her Whole Family On IG After Her Suicide Attempt</a></span></p><h2 id=lashawn-daniels-death-devastates-tamar-braxton>LaShawn Daniels’ Death Devastates Tamar Braxton</h2><p>Forgiveness takes a lot of courage. By Tamar Braxton and LaShawn Daniels coming from religious backgrounds, the two eventually forgave each other. Their friendship proved stronger than any petty fight. Even in death, their friendship and love for one another only grew.</p><p>Tragedy struck in September 2019, when the famous <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">songwriter passed away in a terrible car accident.</a> Sources say that Daniels’ van collided with a truck in South Carolina. Both vehicles caught on fire, resulting in the deaths of both Daniels and the truck driver. The songwriter’s tragic passing left Hollywood in shambles. Several former collaborators and artists expressed their grievances over Daniels's abrupt passing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moreover, Tamar Braxton took to Instagram to pay a tribute to her best friend just days after his death. “LaShawn, I thank you. I love you. I miss you . . . You were truly the best of the best. It’s been so hard these past few days…there was so much left to say, laugh and cry about. My heart aches." Clearly, Daniels was more than a best friend to Braxton. She’d welcomed the 41-year-old into her family.</p><p>The songstress even took time to reminisce on all their achievements. Soon after, she posted a playlist of all LaShawn’s hit songs, including her “Love & War” song and album. The album’s 6-year anniversary coincided with Daniels’ death, making it the perfect tribute. “EVERY Time I sing this song Love & War, I PROMISE to dedicate it to you my friend!! EVERY concert, you will be remembered. This is my way of honoring you, for our true friendship. And always being reminded of the bond that was created by God!!! Although many people played a part (other producers, writers music/tv, etc) ONLY YOU and I together shared a #1 tv show, a #1 song AND #1 album at the same damn time.” Given Braxton’s post, Daniel had a huge influence over her music career and personal life. He meant plenty to her, especially their undying friendship. Even to this day, Tamar Braxton continues to honor her best friend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tamar Braxton Calls Out WeTV, Producers Of 'Braxton Family Values'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijmquYlsSvecOapaKdnKh6orrDZquapZGneqO%2BwLGrqKZdp7KtrdOipqermJ69brLAnKusZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-are-mehwish-omer-and-stephanie-gonzalez-two-women-arrested-for-assaulting-41-year-old-jewish-woman-in-nyc-691080-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who are Mehwish Omer and Stephanie Gonzalez?
