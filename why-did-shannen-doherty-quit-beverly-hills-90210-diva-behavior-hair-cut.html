Despite her body of work, she's always going to be Brenda to 90210 fans. Doherty also joined the <a href=#>BH90210 reboot which paid the cast tens of thousands</a> of dollars.

Larry Mollin, a producer and writer on Beverly Hills 90210, talked about why <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shannen Doherty was asked to leave 90210</a>. According to Entertainment Weekly, he gave an interview and said that she cut her hair short, and that was the real problem.</p><p>Mollin said, "what happened was, in the middle of a show, she cut her hair and totally screwed us up for continuity so everyone was pissed off at her. Like I said, not the writers so much, but the producer people. And the other kids were out to get her head, because she had pissed everybody off."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/luke-perry-shannen-doherty.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mollin also said that he and the writing team thought that Doherty was a talented actress who was really good at her job. He said, "the writers loved Shannen. She’s a child of this business. You give her a script and she’ll just read it exactly like you wrote it. Never change a word, never ask a question. She had a photographic memory."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Is ‘Beverly Hills: 90210’ Star Shannen Doherty Worth Today?</a></span></p><p>It seemed like a main character like Brenda would never leave the series. The POV of Beverly Hills 90210 is through the eyes of twins Brenda and Brandon Walsh (played by Jason Priestley) as they relocate from Minnesota to Beverly Hills, California. Absolutely everything is different and the teenagers are fancier and more sophisticated, throwing thousands of dollars at clothing and driving expensive cars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brenda's relationship with Luke Perry's character Dylan McKay is one of the best parts of Beverly Hills 90210. When Brenda moved away, she had already accepted that Dylan had fallen in love with her best friend Kelly, but over the years, fans heard that Brenda and Dylan had reconnected again.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-shannen-doherty-39-s-beverly-hills-90210-character-brenda-walsh>What Happened To Shannen Doherty's Beverly Hills 90210 Character Brenda Walsh?</h2><p>Shannen Doherty's last Beverly Hills 90210 episode was the season 4 episode called "Mr. Walsh Goes To Washington."

It made sense for Brenda to decide that staying in Beverly Hills wasn't the best thing for her as she had some challenges over the years that brought on painful memories, like fighting with Kelly over Dylan.
