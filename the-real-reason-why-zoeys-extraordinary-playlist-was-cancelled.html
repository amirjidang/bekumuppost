show is on the air. Networks want success, and if a show isn't up to snuff, they will cancel it without even thinking twice about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some shows are <a href=#>cancelled after one season</a>, some are <a href=#>gone after one episode</a>, and some a <a href=#>tossed aside before getting to tell a bigger story</a>. No matter the case, it's never fun to see a series get pulled from the network.</p><p>Over the last two years, there has been a lot of buzz about Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist, but it was cancelled after two seasons. Let's take a look at the show and find out why.</p><h2 id=39-zoey-39-s-extraordinary-playlist-39-was-a-fun-show>'Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist' Was A Fun Show</h2><p>January 2020 saw the debut of Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist, a show that looked like a ton of fun based on its previews alone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starring names like Jane Levy, Skylar Astin, and Mary Steenburgen, the series was about "a whip-smart computer coder who’s making her way in San Francisco. After an unusual event, Zoey, who always preferred podcasts over pop songs, suddenly starts to hear the innermost wants, thoughts, and desires of the people around her – her family, co-workers, and complete strangers – through popular songs," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Series Finale</a>.</p><p>The writing was solid, the music was great, and each episode brought something fresh to the table.</p><p>The show's debut season was able to rope in what became a loyal audience, and suddenly, a second season of the series was on the way.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Why Fans Thought Cobra Kai Was Canceled</a></span></p><h2 id=it-lasted-for-two-seasons>It Lasted For Two Seasons</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The January following the show's debut, season two made its way to the small screen looking to build on the success of season one.</p><p>Levy discussed what season two held for her character, saying, "Yeah, so at the end of season 1 Zoey loses her father, that's not much of a spoiler, you know that's what the whole season is about it's him slowly dying. and the beginning of season 2 Zoey is still very much grieving her father's death and will continue to. But I believe her grief will start to change shape throughout the season."</p><p>Much like the season preceding it, season two of Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist had a lot to like about it. Fans were devouring the content they were receiving, and once the season concluded, they patiently waited for an announcement signaling plans for a third season.</p><p>Sadly, that announcement never came.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In what came as a total surprise to many, the series was not picked up for a third season, and it was officially coming to and end after just two seasons.</p><p>In an interview, Levy expressed her disappointment with the show's cancellation.</p><p>"I’m sorry, but I have to say this: I look at the new NBC lineup, and it’s like, ‘Okay, we could watch a lot of shows about crime and guns.' Our show is about love. It’s a real shame to take that off the air. I feel like it’s the wrong move," she said.</p><p>It seemed like everything was moving along well for the show, so why was it axed by the network?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Fans Were Absolutely Convinced 'Burden Of Truth' Was Canceled</a></span></p><h2 id=why-was-it-cancelled>Why Was It Cancelled?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, this series, despite its vocal fan base, was not able to maintain decent enough ratings to stick around on NBC.</p><p>"As with all ill-fated shows, Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist suffered from the dreaded curse of falling ratings in Season 2. On average, its second season garnered 1.8 million total viewers, which was down 10 percent from its first season. The most crushing blow to the show was the 17 percent loss in the 18-49 demo. That's absurd. They love making playlists," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Distractify</a> reported.</p><p>Fans were disappointed, but in a turn of events, the show had a brief continuation with a Christmas film that was released back in December! It might not have been a full season of the show, but it was still nice for fans to catch up with their favorite characters.</p><p>The movie was a lot of fun for fans, and while they were appreciative, they were still left wondering about a third season and what that would have looked like.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rumors were swirling about a third season of the show actually happening, but as of this moment, a third season has not been confirmed. Fans, however, are still hoping that Roku, who now has the rights to the show, will make a third season happen.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Barney And Friends' Could Have Been Canceled For These Shocking Reasons</a></span></p><p>Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist was a cool show that fans genuinely loved.
