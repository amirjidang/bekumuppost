His drive and education have resulted in him moving up through the journalist world, culminating in earning a regular gig as a host on Fox News. His show is one of the most popular on all of television, which is where the majority of his net worth has come from.</p><p>Here's everything to know about Tucker and how much money he makes.</p><h2 id=everything-to-know-about-tucker-carlson><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Everything To Know About Tucker Carlson</span></h2><p>Tucker has been a spokesperson for Fox News for a while, but who exactly is he?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tucker was born all the way back in 1969 in San Francisco, California. While not everything from his childhood city has stuck with him, he still holds a love for a lot of the music and culture that hails from there. He also lived in places like San Diego, Nevada, and Vermont, but the latter two were mainly vacation homes.</p><p>He attended multiple colleges, including St. George's Boarding School in Rhode Island. According to The Week, after college, Tucker applied to join the CIA but was rejected. That was when he decided to enter into a career in journalism.</p><h2 id=what-is-tucker-carlson-39-s-net-worth><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>What Is Tucker Carlson's Net Worth?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to The Baltimore Sun, Tucker got his first big break as a journalist when he interviewed former president George W. Bush for the celebrity magazine 'Talk'. While the interview didn't paint Bush in a positive light, that wouldn't stop Tucker from gaining fame as a right-wing columnist. According to 'The Washington Post', Tucker would then go on to write for acclaimed media establishments such as 'Esquire', 'The Daily Beast' and 'The Wall Street Journal'.</p><p>Despite generally having his views aligned with conservatives, Tucker actually got his television start on CNN. He still did represent right-wing politics, however, on their shows The Spin Room' and 'Crossfire'. It wasn't until 2009 that Tucker got his job with Fox News.</p><p>After multiple world-changing <a href=#>allegations towards former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly and Fox News founder Roger Ailes</a>, Tucker stood tall as the new face of Fox News.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Mel Gibson's Publicist Ended His Interview With Fox News After A Will Smith And Chris Rock Question</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All of this had led to Tucker having a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$30 million net worth</a>. Most of this has come from being the host of 'Tucker Carlson Tonight', but some of that has come from his collection of books as an author.</p><h2 id=everything-to-know-about-tucker-carlson-39-s-real-estate-portfolio><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Everything To Know About Tucker Carlson's Real Estate Portfolio</span></h2><p>Florida has become a popular moving spot for people of all ages. This includes Tucker, whose primary residence is on Gasparilla Island in southwest Florida. According to Miami Herald, his home was in the path of 2022's Hurricane Ian, but the storm never affected his home.</p><p>According to CA Knowledge, Tucker also has thirteen real estate properties overall. Not much about his other properties is known, but he did sell his former Washington D.C. home in 2020 for over $3 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-tucker-carlson-have-a-cool-car-collection><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Does Tucker Carlson Have A Cool Car Collection?</span></h2><p>Tucker indeed has an insane car collection, something many fans might not know about the usually modest celebrity.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>5 Stars Who Drive Modest Cars, and 5 Stars Who Ride In Nothing But Luxury</a></span></p><p>Tucker might not spend much money on his homes, but he does like to buy really nice cars. According to InfoNetWorth, Tucker has amassed a car collection that includes a BMW 440i, a Genesis G70, and an Audi S5. His most expensive vehicle is a Porsche Panamera.</p><h2 id=what-other-hobbies-does-tucker-carlson-partake-in><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>What Other Hobbies Does Tucker Carlson Partake In?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An outdoor hobby that Tucker partakes in is called fly fishing. It's not very popular, but it's one of Tucker's favorite things to do. It's not quite fishing, but it is a similar activity. Just like traditional fishing, it involves catching smaller fish for sport. However, the methods to catch the fish are completely different. Tucker has discussed his fly-fishing hobby in interviews and has been recorded visiting a Montana fly-fishing store.</p><h2 id=how-much-money-has-tucker-carlson-spent-on-his-obsession-with-the-grateful-dead><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>How Much Money Has Tucker Carlson Spent On His Obsession With The Grateful Dead?</span></h2><p>It's not surprising that Tucker's favorite music group is the progressive rock band The Grateful Dead. He did grow up in San Francisco after all. But how much of a fan is he?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Tucker himself, he is a massive, massive fan. There are pictures of Tucker meeting musician Jerry Garcia, there have been interviews with band members, and Tucker's even included the band in some of his biographical moments. According to Variety, he's attended <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">over 70 concerts</a> of the band, which certainly adds up to a lot of money.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirrpubmr9ur8Cro6ynnmK7psCMsKarrJhiwLGxzZ2gp59dmK6zecKoo6Wdk6m2sLqMraadmalk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./heres-how-scream-queens-changed-the-life-of-jamie-lee-curtis.html>&#171;&nbsp;Here's How 'Scream Queens' Changed The Life Of Jamie Lee Curtis</a>
