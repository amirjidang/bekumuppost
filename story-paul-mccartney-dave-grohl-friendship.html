He and <strong>Paul McCartney</strong> have known each other for many years, and from the beginning, the Beatle was intrigued by the Foo Fighters frontman.

He had been invited by Dhani Harrison to the Concert For George at the Royal Albert Hall Theatre, where all the greatest rock stars were going to come together for a tribute to George Harrison. This was in 2002. He watched the show in awe, but it was only when he was taken to the VIP after-party that he was able to meet the legendary Beatle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As he wrote on his storytelling account on Medium, Dave's True Stories, just seeing Paul took his breath away. "I noticed Paul McCartney out of the corner of my eye, chatting away with friends, and I couldn’t help but stare. There. He. Was," Dave shared. "What happened next will forever remain a blur. I don’t recall exactly how Paul and I were introduced, what was said, or how long we talked, but I do remember putting on my best 'this is not the most incredible thing ever to happen to me' face while trying to keep from making a fool of myself."</p><p>The story of that first meeting ends with Dave running to his hotel room to call his mother Virginia, another huge <a href=#>Beatles </a>fan, and tell her everything about that amazing night.</p><h2 id=their-wives-became-friends><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Their Wives Became Friends</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After that initial meeting, it was a while before Paul and Dave had the chance to develop a friendship. They met at parties here and there, but the people that actually established a direct line of contact between the two musicians were their wives, Jordyn Blum and <a href=#>Nancy Shevell</a>. Dave didn't specify when or where it happened, but he shared that the two women hit it off and swapped numbers. After that, the four of them started going to dinner whenever they were in the same city, and a beautiful friendship blossomed.</p><h2 id=dave-paid-tribute-to-paul-in-many-situations><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Dave Paid Tribute To Paul In Many Situations</span></h2><p>Despite being very close, Dave is always aware of the fact that his dear friend is the legendary <a href=#>Paul McCartney</a>.

This is why he was happy to participate in the tribute for Dave that was put together for the Shockwaves NME Awards 2011 when the Foo Fighters frontman received the Godlike Genius award. If Paul McCartney thinks he's worthy to be called a godlike genius, then Dave is clearly doing something right.</p><h2 id=paul-participated-in-dave-s-documentary><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Paul Participated In Dave's Documentary</span></h2><p>In 2013, Dave released a documentary called Sound City, a film he made about the legendary studio Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, Los Angeles. That was the place where <a href=#>Nirvana recorded the album Nevermind</a>, and when the studio closed in 2011, Dave felt the need to keep its history alive.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Paul McCartney & Other Celebs Who Got Married After They Turned 50</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He purchased several items from it, including the soundboard, and decided to immortalize the studio in a movie. He contacted many important artists like Stevie Nicks, Tom Petty, Corey Taylor, and of course, Paul McCartney. With Paul and his former Nirvana bandmates, Krist Novoselic and Pat Smear, they wrote the song "Cut Me Some Slack", which appeared on the soundtrack of the documentary and won a Grammy in 2014.</p><h2 id=paul-gave-dave-s-daughter-piano-lessons><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Paul Gave Dave's Daughter Piano Lessons</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dave recently told the story about the time <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul gave his middle child Harper piano lessons</a>, and it feels too amazing to be real. Whenever Dave talked about Paul visiting his house in interviews, he always joked about how he had to hide all of the Beatles posters and books so that he wouldn't freak Paul out with his devotion to the band, but he had never mentioned this small and incredible story. Apparently, right after Dave's youngest daughter Ophelia was born, <a href=#>Paul and his wife Nancy</a> were in Los Angeles and wanted to meet her. Dave invited them over and they all had dinner, but right before the couple had to leave, the Beatle eyed the piano in the living room and decided to play some songs. Harper, then five years old and amused with the situation, went to the kitchen, brought a coffee cup, and put some change in it like it was a tip jar, making everyone laugh. Then, she sat next to him, and Paul taught her some chords. That was, according to Dave, the only time he took a picture of his friend, because he wanted to remember that moment forever.</p><h2 id=the-foo-fighters-asked-paul-to-play-drums-for-them---and-paul-said-yes><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Foo Fighters Asked Paul To Play Drums For Them - And Paul Said Yes</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For their 2017 album, Concrete and Gold, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Foo Fighters asked the Beatle to play drums on one of their songs,</a> "Sunday Rain". The reason for this was that, when Dave wrote that song, he felt that it would sound better if their drummer Taylor Hawkins sang it. At first, Dave was going to play the drums, but then Paul McCartney came to Los Angeles, and the frontman had the idea of asking him to play the drums. Paul's first reaction was to laugh, because while he is a good drummer, that's not something he usually does, but when he saw that his friend was serious, he decided to give it a try. Needless to say, it was amazing.</p><h2 id=paul-inducted-the-foo-fighters-into-the-rock-amp-roll-hall-of-fame><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Paul Inducted the Foo Fighters Into The Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fall 2021, Paul gave Dave and the rest of the Foo Fighters one of the best gifts of their lives by inducting them into the <a href=#>Rock & Roll Hall of Fame</a>. He gave a sweet and funny speech, explaining the parallels between his own career and Dave's, and then finished by saying they were one of the greatest bands of all time. He even played the Beatles classic "Get Back" with the band.
