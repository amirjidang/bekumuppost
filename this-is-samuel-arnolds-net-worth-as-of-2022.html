actor</a>&nbsp;Samuel Arnold has accumulated an estimated net worth of $1 million a little over two years after appearing on the Netflix original Emily in Paris in 2020. The 25 year old actor has been acting since he moved to London in 2015 and just went back to Paris to film <a href=#>the series Emily in Paris</a>. He was initially interested in dancing until he became passionate towards acting when he moved to London and has since acted in different projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Samuel Arnold was born on July 12, 1995 and was raised in Paris, France. His parent’s names and identity has been privately kept until today as well as his relationship status. Although reports claim that unlike his character in Emily in Paris, Arnold is straight and has a secret girlfriend. Being born in the city of fashion, he always has interest towards the latest trends in fashion and has always been up to date with the latest trends.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Cast Of 'Emily In Paris', Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=struggling-to-jumpstart-his-career>Struggling To Jumpstart His Career</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Growing up, Samuel Arnold has always had interest towards acting as well as performing. He started his career as a hip-hop dancer and he never thought he would become a famous actor while <a href=#>he was pursuing his passion for dancing</a>. He was inspired by Michael Jackson at the time and decided to start dancing hip-hop. He was part of a dance group during that time and they were invited to the reality show France Got Talent in 2009. However they did not have much luck joining the competition.</p><p>During the time he was pursuing dancing, he was studying acting at the International Film & Television School Paris, EICAR, from 2012 until 2013. After he finished attending EICAR, he decided to continue studying acting from 2013 until 2015 at the Giles Foreman Centre For Acting. At the time it was the perfect place for him to hone his acting skills while dancing since GFCA is one of the academies who offers both full time and part time training for intensive acting. While trying to make a name for himself, he has worked different odd jobs to make ends meet including taking a job as a bartender at a Mexican restaurant in London.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=breaking-into-acting-industry>Breaking into Acting&nbsp;Industry</h2><p>After moving to London in 2015, Arnold started trying his luck on the acting industry. He had a minor role a year after as a robber in the TV movie titled Tuer un Homme in 2016. He had no luck snagging a role for two years until he was finally cast in National Theatre Live: Antony & Cleopatra in 2018 as Supernumeraries. The show <a href=#>which has adapted works of William Shakespeare</a>’s Antony & Cleopatra ran from September 18, 2018 until January 19, 2019. The show runs for about three hours and thirty minutes which included the interval which was held at the Olivier Theatre. Although it was Sophie Okonedo and Ralph Fiennes who led the show, Arnold’s role as Supernumeraries left a mark in the audience and critics who watched the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After his role in the live play, he finally snagged a role in the TV series titled Platane as Graffeur. Platane is about the protagonist Eric who fell into coma after hitting a tree in a car accident. The series which ran for three seasons only had Arnold for two episodes but his performance left a mark to the critics that he eventually won the hearts of many. Finally he was casts at the Netflix original series Emily in Paris which became his international debut.</p><h2 id=success-and-earnings>Success and Earnings</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starring in Emily in Paris has made Arnold find his way to a successful career. He worked in the series for 2020 until 2021. Although he is not the main character, the viewers fell in love with his witty character which <a href=#>adds entertainment to the show</a>. He became a popular actor right after his stint as Julien in the show. It was reported that he specifically went back to Paris just to shoot the show. As he was already based in London, he had to crash and stay at Ashley Park's two bedroom apartment with his co-star Lucas Bravo for about a month and a half to film the show.</p><p>His salary for doing the show is not disclosed to the public, however before getting the job for Emily in Paris, he was reported to be struggling during his times in London. Suffice to say that his stint at the popular Netflix original made him accumulate $1 million net worth.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>This Is Ana de Armas' Net Worth As Of 2022</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Married Biography</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">News Unzip</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbXSZqCsZaOWuraxy2aYq6afobG0ec2eq2avn6fBqXnArGSonl1nfXN%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./tony-shalhoub-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Tony Shalhoub Net Worth | TheRichest</a>
