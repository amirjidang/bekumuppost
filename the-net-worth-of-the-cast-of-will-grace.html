The show follows the life of two roommates and the ultimate&nbsp;besties, Will Truman and Grace Adler; and their friends: drunken socialite, Karen Walker, and witty-actor Jack McFarland.</p><p>The show ended in 2006, but after a brief reunion special in 2016, the show has returned for a ninth season. Due to the success and cultural impact of the show, the cast and several guest stars have continued to strive in the entertainment industry. How much are the girls and guys of <i>Will & Grace</i> worth today?</p><p>Here is the net worth of the cast from <i>Will & Grac</i>e.</p><h2 id=erick-mccormack---net-worth-15-million>Erick McCormack - Net Worth: $15 Million</h2><p>Canadian actor and singer, Eric McCormack, portrays lawyer and the gay best-friend of Grace, Will Truman. Throughout the show, Will is seen as an uptight, over-bearing man, but his love for his friends, particularly Grace, showcases his softer side and his undying loyalty to the ones he loves. McCormack began acting in high school and played in numerous stage productions after leaving Ryerson University.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the 1990s, McCormack had minor roles before making his film debut in the movie The Lost World. Prior to gaining recognition for his role on Will & Grace, the actor was featured in the shows&nbsp;Ally McBeal, Street Justice, Lonesome Dove: The Series, and Law and Order: Special Victims Unit. McCormack also had a main role in the show&nbsp;Travelers. Reportedly, McCormack was paid $125,000 per episode, <a href=#>rounding out his estimated net worth to $15 million</a>.</p><h2 id=debra-messing---net-worth-20-million>Debra Messing - Net Worth: $20 Million</h2><p>Grace Adler is a Jewish interior-designer who was once engaged to Will, but after discovering he was gay, the two broke-up. Years later, the two ran into each other and reconnected, forming an unspeakable bond that fans envied for 10 seasons. Debra Messing portrayed Grace, and it is considered to be her break-through role. Before she became the erratic roommate of Will, the actress had a few minor roles on&nbsp;Ned & Stacy and Prey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Messing then transitioned to the big screen and was seen in the films&nbsp;Along with Polly, The Women, The Wedding Date, Searching, and Lucky You.&nbsp; From 2012-2013, Messing played Julia Houston on the NBC musical-drama, Smash, and homicide detective Laura Diamond on the show The Mysteries of Laura. The Brooklyn-native's <a href=#>estimated net worth is $20 million</a>.</p><h2 id=megan-mullally---net-worth-15-million>Megan Mullally - Net Worth: $15 Million</h2><p>Actress, comedian, and singer Megan Mullally, portrays the spoiled, rich, borderline alcoholic Karen Walker. Karen is married to multi-millionaire Stan Walker and lives in a mansion with maids and staff members she usually mistreats. Karen also works as an assistant to Grace out of boredom and is occasionally seen doing some sort of hilarious scheme with Jack.</p><p>Mullally&nbsp;received several accolades for her portrayal of Karen Walker, including eight Primetime Emmy Nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. From 2006-2007, the actress hosted her own show, The Megan Mullaly Show, and appeared in several films and shows, including&nbsp;Why Him?, Boston Legal, Parks and Recreation, and Bob's Burgers.

Sean Hayes makes this character simply unforgettable. Jack is a not-so-talented actor that has no problem living off the success of his friends, particularly Karen. While Jack may seem as an opportunist, he also is a firm supporter of gay rights and was also the one who helped Will come out in his 20s.</p><p>Hayes also gained acclaim and accolades for his portrayal in Will & Grace and has continued to lend his talents to the acting and theater world. Hayes has starred in the films&nbsp;Cats & Dogs, Soul Men, The Bucket List, and Pieces of April.

Morrison's character was originally created for a brief one-episode appearance, however Rosario became popular with the show's fans and was added as a recurring character. Morrison has been active in the industry since 1961, however, after Will & Grace ended she officially retired from acting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Morrison currently resides in California with her husband and <a href=#>her estimated net worth is $800,000</a>.</p><h2 id=michael-angarano---net-worth-4-million>Michael Angarano - Net Worth: $4 Million</h2><p>In season 3, Sean Hayes' character Jack was informed that he had a biological son named Elliot.

Reynolds was best known for her breakout role in the film&nbsp;Singin' In The Rain, but she reached a younger audience at the turn of the millennium when she starred in the Halloweentown film series and Will & Grace. Reynolds portrayed the bossy and hilarious Bobbi Adler, the mother of Grace.</p><p>Reynolds was the real-life mother of actress Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia in the Star Wars films. Fisher passed away at the age of 60, and the following day Reynolds unfortunately passed away after being hospitalized. Reynolds was also a singer and businesswoman, and <a href=#>her estate's net worth is $85 million</a>.</p><h2 id=blythe-danner---net-worth-45-million>Blythe Danner - Net Worth: $45 Million</h2><p>Blythe Danner is probably most recognized from her role as Dina Byers from the films&nbsp;Meet The Parents, Meet The Fockers, and Little Fockers,&nbsp;but this actress has also starred in several other films and also portrayed an important&nbsp;role in&nbsp;Will & Grace.
