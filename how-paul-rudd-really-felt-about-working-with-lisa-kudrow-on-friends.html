The two eventually marry, and The 40-Year-Old Virgin actor appeared in more episodes than he originally thought he would.</p><p>According to Today, while appearing on Heart Breakfast, a U.K. radio show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rudd commented on how he really felt about working with Kudrow</a> and the other cast members. "It was really fun, and they were great."</p><p>Rudd said, "The whole thing was a bit surreal, I must say, to be a part of that. Because I came on really near the end... I never knew that I was going to be in as many (episodes) as I was." In an interview with Sunday Today, the Clueless actor discussed his recurring role on such a popular show with a close cast.</p><p>"(It was) a little bit like this Marvel stuff where it's like, what an incredible juggernaut of a thing to catch a ride on, to get a seat on this train. But I never, ever thought, 'Oh, I'm really a part of this.' I just didn't want to get in the way."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"And I also didn't anticipate it because when I did it, I was only supposed to do one or two episodes and so I was never under a long contract or anything.

It seems Rudd felt a little intrusive while appearing on the Friends finale.</p><p>He said, "But it also felt strange.

"They were all crying, it was all emotional, and I was just like, 'Woah.' I felt very privileged, but I was like, 'Oh I just want to sit back here and not get in the way.'"</p><p>He also recalled a joke he tried on Jennifer Aniston while they were filming the finale that didn't seem to go over very well.
