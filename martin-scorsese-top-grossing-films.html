Despite being <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vocal about his distaste for today's flashy blockbusters in Hollywood</a>, Scorsese has managed to build such a massive fanbase that even his latest flicks are lighting up the box office.</p><h2 id=the-man-behind-the-camera>The Man Behind The Camera</h2><p>Martin Scorsese was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">born in New York City</a> on November 17th in 1942, and coming from humble beginnings didn't stop this industry legend from reaching great heights. Scorsese's love life has been colorful, as he had not one or two but five marriages; at the moment, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Helen Schermerhorn Morris owns the title</a> of Mrs. Scorsese.</p><p>And speaking of family matters, Scorsese is father to three children – including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one named for her mother (Julia Cameron)</a>, Domenica Cameron-Scorsese.

He believes it is this reinterpretation process that keeps storytelling alive and kicking.</p><p>Scorsese's personal inspiration was drawn from the annals of Hollywood history through the modern day. His favorite films include John Ford's masterpiece The Searchers, Powell and Pressburger's enthralling creation The Red Shoes, and Federico Fellini’s thought-provoking gem 8½.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Richest Film Directors In Hollywood, Ranked</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Scorsese is also a fan of Orson Welles' iconic magnum opus Citizen Kane, and Luchino Visconti's timeless work, The Leopard.
