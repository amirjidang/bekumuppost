daughter of businessman Richard Hilton and socialite Nicky Hilton. <a href=#>A born heiress, her great-grandfather Conrad Hilton was the founder of Hilton Hotels</a>. Growing up, she divided her time between New York and Los Angeles, hanging out with other socialites like Nicole Richie and Kim Kardashian. Known for her days of partying and having fun, she came into the public eye after her hit show <i>The Simple Life</i> aired on television. She also spent time modeling and endorsing a variety of brands. Paris Hilton has established herself as a popular businesswoman with her successful beauty brand and as the world’s highest-paid female DJ. Over the years, <a href=#>she has garnered $300 million worth of fortune</a>.</p><p>When Paris Hilton and Carter Reum began dating in 2019, she was sure he was the one for her. The couple has been in a steady relationship and got engaged in February 2021. They decided to buy a stunning Malibu mansion for $8 million before tying the knot in November 2021. Let’s take a look inside her beautiful beach home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-contemporary-home-of-the-90s>A Contemporary Home Of The 90s</h2><p>The home owned by Paris Hilton was originally constructed in 1955 and underwent a cosmetic upgrade in the 90s. The owner from that time had sold the property for $8.4 million to Tom Pollock, a big-time executive producer who served as a Chairperson of Universal Pictures, as noted by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Post</a>. Over the next fourteen years, the property had varying costs, including the realtor commissions. Paris Hilton and Carter Reum got the home for an efficient rate and even saved an additional $400,000 from the purchase. The listing was under Ali Gagerman and Chris Cortazzo from Compass Realty.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Inside Mark Cuban's $19 Million Laguna Beach House</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Spanning 3,000 square feet, the beachfront mansion has a contemporary exterior but is built with a vintage-inspired decor. Located on the busy Pacific Coast Highway, the blocky estate has a fortified gate located by a navy blue wall. The entrance also has sleek security cameras installed for utmost protection. Walking past the foyer, a large courtyard is built with an open space for enjoying a peaceful morning. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a>, it leads to the white exterior of the mansion, which resembles the homes in Mykonos, one of Paris Hilton’s favorite vacation destinations.</p><h2 id=steeped-in-spacious-amenities>Steeped In Spacious Amenities</h2><p><a href=#>The perfect Malibu home features</a> three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and various recreational rooms for the couple. Inside the home, the main level has tile flooring and floor-to-ceiling windows that offer views of the beach from every direction. The open-plan living room features a fireplace, clean white couches, and a breakfast nook. Adjoining the room is a concrete deck with a seating area and BBQ station to enjoy the beach views up close. The fireplace finishes the room's outlook which can warm the space on rare chilly nights, as per the listing photos, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">L’Officiel USA</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paris Hilton enjoys cooking and would find it comforting to work in the 90s-inspired kitchen. Along with granite countertops and working space, it is equipped with stainless steel appliances to be the optimum modern kitchen. The salmon-colored tiles are also seen on the stairs that lead to the upper level, which is the location for the three bedrooms. The rooms have hardwood floors, and the oceanfront Master Suite has a private terrace and a fireplace. The ensuite bathroom has a glass-encased shower, dual vanities, and a built-in soaking tub.</p><h2 id=luxury-getaway-for-the-couple>Luxury Getaway For The Couple</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The outdoor deck adjoining the living room has stairs that lead directly to the open shower and the sandy beach of La Costa. As mentioned by <a href=#>Hello Magazine</a>, along with the large terraces, the house also features an outdoor Jacuzzi overlooking the beach. The two-car garage also comes with a workstation that can be used as an additional workspace by the couple. Malibu has always been an exclusive part of California, and some of Hilton’s famous neighbors in the area include Richard Saghian, the CEO of Fashion Nova, Candy Spelling, and author Michael Connelly.</p><p><a href=#>This is not the only property Paris Hilton in Los Angeles owned</a>, as she is also the proud owner of a Mediterranean-style mansion in the Mulholland Estates that she purchased for $5.9 million in 2007. That home has been her primary residence for more than a decade. Another addition to her real estate portfolio includes a New York prewar boutique penthouse she bought in 2014 for $4.9 million.</p><p>Paris Hilton’s newest purchase of the Malibu mansion is the perfect romantic getaway destination for couples who are always steeped in their work. The home offers breathtaking views of the white beach and ocean, and the interior has a peaceful aura to bring comfort with peace. After the purchase, her home was first featured during the promo video of her cooking show <i>Cooking With Paris</i>, which was released on Netflix in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 8 Most Expensive Purchases Of Pete Davidson</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Post</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">L’Officiel USA</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaaZaCasqx5yKeqopyVYr2ivsisZKGhnKm8r7%2BMcWSmoZyhtrC6jKaYpaGSqnqurc2soKimXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-much-money-did-jim-bob-duggar-give-his-kids.html>&#171;&nbsp;After Years Of Not Giving His Kids Their TLC Money, Jim Bob Duggar Offered Them $10 An Hour</a>
