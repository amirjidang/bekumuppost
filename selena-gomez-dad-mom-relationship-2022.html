As Selena got older, her relationship with her parents looked to be strained, yet she kept a good relationship with her grandparents. When Selena’s parents got divorced, it did not make her relationship with her mom and dad any better. This is similar to how <a href=#>Taylor Swift’s parents' separation affected her.</a> Fans are beginning to pick up on the possibility that Selena may not have the best relationship with her parents. Here's why they think that...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez-has-a-positive-relationship-with-her-grandparents>Selena Gomez Has a Positive Relationship with Her Grandparents</h2><p>While Selena Gomez might not have the best relationship with either her mom or dad, she has been seen as having a positive relationship with her grandparents. It is no secret that Selena was raised by her grandparents compared to her parents and was living with her grandparents for most of her childhood and continued to as she got older. Both of Selena’s parents were hard-working trying to be able to provide for their daughter and provide her the life she wants.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> What We Recently Learned About Taylor Swift And Selena Gomez's Friendship</a></span></p><p>Her grandparent recalled a time when Selena, who was 10 at the time, would record her singing and gift them to her grandparents. To this day, her grandparents keep those recordings and listen to them. They have also defended Selena during her darkest times to reveal the truth behind her rumored drug use, secret rehabilitation stays and her life-threatening illness. Selena’s grandparents have also appeared on her cooking show Selena + Chef a few times whereas neither of Selena’s parents has been on once.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez-rsquo-s-relationship-with-her-mom>Selena Gomez’s Relationship with Her Mom</h2><p>While Selena Gomez may always hold a special bond with her mother, as many mothers and daughters do. Also like many other mother and daughters, Selena and her mom Mandy Teefey have their own fair share of conflicts. When Selena was younger, she was really close to her mother and even supported her mom when she went through a miscarriage. She was also there for her mom when she did eventually get pregnant and gave birth to Selena’s little sister.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Has Selena Gomez's Career Finally Peaked?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Selena Gomez was in a relationship with <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a>, there were multiple headlines regarding their being a rift between Selena and her mother. The rift being Selena’s mom Mandy disapproving of Selena’s relationship with Justin and many rumors have fluttered over the years that this was the reason Selena ultimately decided to fire her mother as manager. This just was not the case at all, in fact, the reason was that Selena and her mother had disagreements over her career. Despite Selena firing her mother as her manager, they both went on to co-executive produce the popular <a href=#>Netflix</a> series 13 Reasons Why. Selena and her mother’s complicated relationship was reflected a few times in the series.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> The Real Reason ’13 Reasons Why’ Was Canceled</a></span></p><p>Despite the mother-daughter duo trying to look happier than ever when they attend red carpet events, they can’t hide their true feelings from fans. It is evident that Selena’s mother may never get over feeling emotionally and professionally hurt from being fired from her own daughter as her manager. Selena thought firing her mother as manager was the right thing to do in hopes of helping their relationship, but it may have just affected it even more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez-rsquo-s-relationship-with-her-dad>Selena Gomez’s Relationship with Her Dad</h2><p>Selena Gomez and her father Rick Gomez’s relationship has evidently become very distant over the years and has been obvious to many Selena fans. Since Selena’s parents got divorced, her father has become more of a stranger to her than a father.</p><p>When comes to holidays such as Christmas or even Father’s Day, Selena has never posted a picture of her with her father and never acknowledges her father to wish him a happy birthday or a happy Father’s Day. That feeling is mutual.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Much like Selena does not acknowledge her father, Selena’s father does not recognize Selena on his social media around the holidays or on Selena’s birthday either. When Selena has released new music such as her 2019 album Rare, or announced her new television series, Only Murders in The Building (with a <a href=#>season two script that left Selena shocked</a>) her father has not gone on to congratulate his daughter for her accomplishments and say how proud he is of Selena. The last post Selena’s father Rick’s posted that featured his daughter Selena Gomez was from January 2020 that shows a collage of multiple old photos he found lying around.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Why Selena Gomez Think Her Past Relationships Are Cursed</a></span></p><p>Fans suspect that what caused Selena and her father’s relationship to drift apart is that she did not take her dad moving away from her hometown and starting a new family easily. Despite Selena wanting what is best for her dad, it still hurt seeing him going on dates with another woman who wasn’t her mother.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Selena Gomez may not have a close relationship, or any sort of relationship with her birth father Rick Gomez. Luckily, she has some sort of relationship with her mother Mandy Teefy even if it may be a strained one. When in doubt, Selena knows she can always count on her grandparents, and it noticed that she has a close bond with them.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Selena Gomez's Team Cut The Live Feed Of Her Interview After She Was Asked This Question</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqnqSVo65us86mnLNllJaxbrnOpmSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhdZ31zfo4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./zaya-zion-wade-biography-age-height-family-more-7410-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Zaya (Zion) Wade Biography, Age, Height, Family &amp;amp; More</a>
