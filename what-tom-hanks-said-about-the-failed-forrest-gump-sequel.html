However, when talks of a sequel came up, discussions didn't last long, and Hanks was somehow able to pivot away from what could have been a failure.</p><p>Let's take a look back on what happened!</p><h2 id=tom-hanks-was-not-an-instant-success>Tom Hanks Was Not An Instant Success</h2><p>If you're a fan of great movies and fantastic performances, then you've undoubtedly spent some time watching Tom Hanks on the big screen. The man has had a career for the ages, and he's spent decades entertaining fans around the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hanks was not an instant success, and some of his earlier works have been forgotten about over time. However, once the kid from the Bay Area got a crack at some better roles and projects, he was able to showcase his skills, which set him on a collision course with mainstream success.</p><p>After rising to prominence in the 1980s, Tom Hanks would continue his impressive run into the 1990s and beyond. Through the years, he has been able to star in huge hits, snag some of Hollywood's biggest paydays, and take home the most prestigious awards that the entertainment industry has to offer.</p><p>At this point, Hanks has nothing left to achieve, and yet, he's still doing big things, Just this year, the actor starred in Elvis, alongside Austin Butler.</p><p>Hanks' career has had many triumphs, and this was particularly true during the 1990s. During that decade, he starred in an Oscar-winning picture that remains one of his most famous works.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is Tom Hanks' And His Wife Rita Wilson's Relationship Like?</a></span></p><h2 id=tom-hanks-won-an-academy-award-for-his-performance-in-39-forrest-gump-39>Tom Hanks Won An Academy Award For His Performance In 'Forrest Gump'</h2><p>1994's Forrest Gump is a classic of the decade, and a film that helped Hanks land more prestigious hardware.</p><p>Based on the novel of the same name, the film featured an incredible cast, a wildly entertaining story, and some snotty CGI work that has aged quite poorly. Nevertheless, it was a smash hit, and it made Tom Hanks a fortune.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>, "Playing a simpleton — and shrewdly taking a cut of the box office gross — was one of the smartest business moves in Hollywood history. After Gump took in nearly $680 million worldwide, Hanks walked away with an estimated $60 million."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like other classics, fans were pining to see more of the titular character in action, and because Hollywood loves printing money, talks of a sequel to the beloved classic were once a thing.

And then we never…we said, ‘Guys, come on,'" Hanks said.</p><p>Realistically, the movie never needed a sequel, but Hollywood has never shied away from a shameless cash grab. In this situation, however, Hanks wisely shut things down.</p><p>The actor then went on to talk about not being contractually obligated to make a sequel feature.</p><p>"A smart thing I did is I’ve never signed a contract that had a contractual obligation to a sequel. I’ve always said, ‘Guys, if there’s a reason to do it, let’s do it. But you guys can’t force me.’ There is that natural inclination that is one of pure commerce that says, ‘Hey, you just had a hit, so do it again and you’ll have a hit,'" he added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is How Austin Butler Totally Won Over Tom Hanks While Shooting Elvis</a></span></p><p>Forrest Gump might be a '90s classic, but many elements of the film did not age well at all.
